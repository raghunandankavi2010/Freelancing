<p>The Maple Bear Education System™ was developed for CECN Global Schools to bring a Canadian designed early learning program for children to the world. It was created by Canadian experts and is being constantly upgraded to ensure that the Maple Bear Education System reflects the very best in early childhood education.</p>
<p>CECN Global Schools was established by the Canadian Education Centre Network (CECN) a private non profit company set up in 1995 with the support of Government of Canada dedicated to marketing Canada as destination for international students.</p>
<p>At Maple Bear we believe that there is nothing more important than our children. The goal of the Maple Bear pre-school is to establish an enthusiasm for learning and knowledge in young learners that will serve as a foundation for future success in the formal education system.</p>

<body>
<p>The goal of MapleBear schools is to establish an enthusiasm for learning and knowledge in young children that will serve as a foundation for future success in the education system and in life. In development of the MapleBear program, we have drawn on the best practices in early childhood teaching and learning.</p>
<p>Core Curriculum</p>
<p>MapleBear recognizes that literacy in English is absolutely fundamental to a child\'s success in English medium schools. The ability to read, to understand the written and spoken word, to express oneself in writing and orally are essential to success in all other subjects of study. Language development, books and reading are central to all activities in the program. </p>
<p>Methodology – Learning Through Experience and Exploration</p>
<p>The MapleBear Methodology is based on the well established principle that children learn through experience and exploration. When children enter school they regard learning as a pleasurable experience so they are naturally inclined and eager to learn. It is important that the program reinforce and build on this positive attitude by offering varied and stimulating and enjoyable experiences.</p>
<p>The knowledge and skills that children acquired by the end of kindergarten, along with positive attitudes to learning that children develop in these early years, from the basis of effective learning in the later years of school.</p>
