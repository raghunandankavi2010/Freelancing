Mini Bio:
Batistuta was born on 1 February 1969, to slaughterhouse worker Omar Batistuta and school secretary Gloria Batistuta, in the town of Avellaneda, province of Santa Fe, Argentina, but grew up in the near city of Reconquista. He has three younger sisters, named Elisa, Alejandra, and Gabriela.

At the age of 16, he met Irina Fernandez, his future wife, at her quinceanera, a rite of passage on her 15th birthday. She is reported to have ignored him but five years later, on 28 December 1990, they were married at Saint Roque Church. The couple moved to Florence, Italy, in 1991, and a year later their first son, Thiago, was born. Thanks to good performances in the Italian championship and with the Argentine national team, Batistuta gained fame and respect. He filmed several commercials and was invited onto numerous TV shows, but in spite of this, Batistuta always remained a low-profile family man.

In 1996, during Fiorentina's 2-1 victory at Milan, he celebrated scoring the match's decisive goal by saying Te amo, Irina (I love you, Irina, to his wife) for the cameras. The mix of sex appeal and faithfulness cemented Batistuta's heart-throb reputation among Argentine and Italian women. In 1997, Batistuta's second son, Lucas, was born, and a third son, Joaquin, followed in 1999. He now has a fourth son Shamel. In 2000, Batistuta and his family moved to Rome, where he played for Roma. Two years after Shamel was born, Batistuta was loaned to Inter. In 2002, after more than 10 years in Italy, the family moved to Qatar where Batistuta had accepted a lucrative celebrity playing contract with a local team, Al-Arabi.

Batistuta ended his career at Al-Arabi, retiring in March 2005, after a series of injuries that prevented him from playing. Soon afterwards he moved to Perth, Australia. In April 2006, the city's established A-league franchise, Perth Glory was put up for sale however Batistuta was not interested in the purchase seeing no real potential in the club

PROFILE:
Full name: Hernan Jorge Crespo 
Date of birth: July 5, 1975 (1975-07-05)  
Place of birth: Florida, Argentina 
Height:1.84 m  
Playing position :Striker 

Mini Bio:
Born near Buenos Aires, Crespo, like all kids his age, was a fan of local team River plate, which was on top form when Hernan was growing up. When he was 11 years old, the Argentina soccer team won the 1986 World Cup and Maradona became one of the young boy's heroes. It was around this time that he decided to become a soccer player, trying out several youth clubs before getting into River Plate's youth squad. 


His senior debut for River plate in 1993 was a huge step for the young Argentinean and he immediately made an impact, scoring 13 times in his 25 league appearances that season. More impressive is that he wasn't even a full first team member back then, so some of his goals where scored as a substitute. 


His next two seasons with River plate were very successful, as the team managed to win the Apertura championship ("half" of the Argentinean championship) twice as well as the Copa Libertadores (the most prestigious South American club competition ñ a sort of Champions League), scoring twice in the home leg of the final. 


Obviously, the great form that he was in attracted offers of big European clubs and the ones that managed to get the young striker were Italian Serie A club Parma.

PROFILE:
Full name :Alfredo di Stefano Laulhe
Date of birth: 4 July 1926 (1926-07-04)  
Place of birth : Buenos Aires, Argentina 
Height :1.78 m  
Playing position : Attacking midfielder 

Mini Bio:
Alfredo Di Stefano is right up there with Pele and Maradona if you list out the best footballers ever. He was an absolute revelation during his Real Madrid days, helping them to five consecutive European cups. He initially played for Argentina, Columbia national teams and later he changed his allegiance to Spain where he made his mark. Royal Spanish Football Federation selected Di Stefano as their Golden player of last five decades in 2003. Currently he is Real Madridís honorary president. He was the European footballer of the year in 1957 and 1959.real Madrid has named their practise ground as Alfredo di Stefano stadium. 

Alfredo Di Stefano Laulhe was born on 4th July in 1926 at Buenos Aires. ìSaeta Rubiaî is his nickname. At the age of 17, Di Stefano started his football career with one of the top Argentinean club, River Plate in 1943.He played for Huracan during 1946 season as loanee. He won Argentinean league during 1945 and 1947 seasons with River plate. He was league top scorer in 1947.He scored 49 goals for River plate during his stint with them. He moved to Columbian league team Millionaires of Bogota in 1949 following a strike by footballers in Argentina. He won four Columbian championships with Bogot·. He also won Columbian cup, and two other cups with Bogota. He was the top scorer in Columbian league during 1951 and 1952 seasons.

He moved to real Madrid in 1953.This transfer involved bitter dispute between Barcelona and real Madrid, which lead to government intervention. It happened as there was too much confusion and bullying involved .At first Di Stefano signed a contract with Barcelona in 1953, with permission from FIFA, as they thought that he moved from River Plate club who had rights over him. However, they were not aware of the fact that Stefano left Millionaires club without their permission. Spanish football federation did not ratify the deal. His ownership was a complex deal as Millionaires had rights over him until 1954 and river plate had rights from 1955 onwards, so that meant, any transfer deal must involve the consent of two clubs. Millionaires club complained about Di Stefanoís transfer, with FIFA. The responsibility fell on Spanish football federation to solve it. There were division of opinions in Barcelonaís board regarding the transfer. While Di Stefano came to Spain, president of Real Madrid convinced him to join the Madrid club. However Spanish government made a decision, which allowed Stefano to play for 2 seasons with Barcelona and 2 seasons with Real Madrid. This lead to the resignation of Barcelona president as public went furious about this. However, Di Stefano went to play for Real Madrid until 1964.

He is certainly a legend of Real Madrid. He was part of a great striking pair, which involved Puskas. Di Stefano won eight Spanish league titles with Real Madrid. He won the top scorers trophy five times during his stint with real Madrid. He was instrumental in five consecutive European cup wins of Real Madrid from 1956 to 1960.He won two Latin cups, intercontinental cup in 1960,copa del Rey in 1962 and pequena copa del Mundo de clubes in 1956 with Real Madrid. He won European player of the year awards twice, in 1957 and 1959.He scored 49 goals in 58 European cup matches for real Madrid. His performances yielded him four ìSpanish player of the year awards. He joined Espanyol in 1964 and retired from club football in 1966.He scored 227 goals while playing in Spain. He scored 377 goals in 521 matches he played during his career. Watch out for amazing Alfredo goals here.

Di Stefano played for Argentina, Columbia, and Spain. He played overall 41 games .He never had the chance to play in world cup due to circumstances. Argentina did not participate in 1950 world cup. In 1954 he was ineligible for Spain. He got citizenship in 1956. He helped Spain, to qualify for 1962-world cup. However he did not play in it due to injury. He bid adieu to International football that year.

PROFILE:
Full name : Mario Alberto Kempes 
Date of birth :July 15, 1954 (1954-07-15) 
Place of birth :Bell Ville, Argentina 
Height :1.82 m  
Playing position : Striker

Mini Bio:
Mario Kempes was born on 15 July 1954 in Cordoba Argentina. His father being an avid football player in his young days, persuaded the little Kempes to play the game at the tender age of 9. Exactly 7 years later, Kempes led the local team to the district championship as top goalscorer.

On 5th October 1973, Mario Kempes made his first appearance for the Instituto de Cordoba club. The game was played against Newell's Old Boys and Kempeís team lost by a score of 0-1.  Though he was successful as a club player in Argentina, Kempes biggest achievements came with the national team. He had hit the goal 20 times in just 43 international appearances. On 19th April 1972, he played in an under-18 match against Portugal in Cannes and scored in their 3-1 victory. The South American qualifying rounds of the 1974 FIFA World Cup were another event which fetched him instant recognition for his good work

Mario Kempes made a total of 18 World Cup appearances. Argentina performed disastrously in Germany 1974 and Kempes failed to make his presence felt by failing to score a goal in the tournament. However, three years later Kempes became a sweetheart among the fans and also a leading goalscorer at Rosario Central by striking 100 goals in two seasons. The words used by Cesar Luis Menotti to describe Kempes when announcing the team for the 1978 tournament is as follows, ìHe's strong, he's got skill, he creates spaces and he shoots hard. He's a player who can make a difference, and he can play in a centre-forward positionî.

The 25th of June, 1978 is a date that brought joy to the Argentinean people. Kempes had scored two goals in the final, leading his team to a victory of 3-1 against Holland. The first goal was shot in the first half, in the 38th minute, while the second was shot in the extra time. Right after the victory, Kempes said, ìWinning the World Cup was just what the long-suffering people of Argentina needed; it brought joy into their lives. I remember that I was called up because other players, like Osvaldo Piazza, couldn't be included. I wore the number 10 shirt, and Diego Maradona, who I'd never seen play, was left out. Of course, he went on to become the greatest Argentinean player of all time. However, I was also the second-ever Argentinean to be the leading goalscorer in a World Cup, after Guillermo St·bileî.

In his entire club career he had turned out for River Plate (81/82) in Argentina, Rosario Central (74/76) and Instituto de Cordoba (73/74). During the period of 1986 to 1992, Kempes enjoyed playing in Austria with First Vienna, Saint Polten and Kremser. By 1992-93 he bid goodbye to active football for a span of three years. During this period, he received List of few Honours from the Government of the Province of Mendoza and was employed in Valencia as assistant to the Uruguayan coach Hector Nunez. However, in 1995 Kempes made a return to world-class football in Chile, before becoming the manager of Indonesian League champions Pelita Hyatt. Finally, he retired at the age of 41

<p>Diego Maradona</p>
<i>
PROFILE:
Full name : Diego Armando Maradona 
Date of birth  : 30 October 1960 (1960-10-30)  
Place of birth : Lanus, Argentina 
Height : 1.63 m  
Playing position : Attacking Midfielder/Second Striker 

Mini Bio:

Diego Armando Maradona is arguably the greatest footballer that has ever put on a pair of boots. He is born in the slums of Villa Fiorito near Buenos Aires as the fifth of eight children. Maradona enters professional football at the astonishing age of 15. By the time he turns 16, Diego is called in the senior national squad of Argentina. Regardless of his talent, Diego is considered too young by coach Cesar Menotti, who rejects him from his selection for the 1978 World Cup. Bitterly disappointed, Maradona watches the tournament from home as his country wins gold. In the following four years, Diego dominates his country's domestic league and is eventually added to the Argentine squad for Spain 1982.

Argentina advances from the first stage of the tournament by losing to Belgium, but beating Hungary and Salvador. Maradona manages to leave his mark with two beautiful, yet not critical goals. In the the second stage of the tournament, Maradona is manhandled by his Italian marker Claudio Gentile. Diego's frustration gets him sent off. Argentina fails to advance and Diego is again suppressed from unleashing his full potential. Although unsuccessful, the brilliance of the Argentine footballer does not go unnoticed and after the World Cup, he is picked up by European powerhouse Barcelona. By 1984, Maradona had established himself in Barca and is picked up by the Italian club Napoli.

At the 1986 World Cup in Mexico, Maradona makes his return on the World stage in a spectacular fashion. After leading his team to a quarter final against England, Diego steals the attention of millions with both his controversial character and technical brilliance. The fuss around the Argentina-England encounter is further elevated by the Falkland Islands conflict, which at that time had turned both countries against each other. Diego opens the game 1-0 by striking the ball with his hand over the English goalkeeper Shilton. Unnoticed by the referees, the mishap is ruled a goal. Five minutes later, Maradona single handedly takes the ball through the entire English defense with a slalom from midfield right down to the goal line. After the match, when confronted with the video footage of the illegal goal, Maradona replies simply "Even if there was a hand, it must have been the hand of God." Maradona silenced his critics by deciding the following semi and final matches. By scoring two goals in the first and with an assist in the second, Maradona practically earns the World Cup for his nation.
Maradona's influence on his teammates was carried over to his club side Napoli, as they reached unprecedented heights, winning their very first and second Scudetto (1997 and 1990) and the UEFA Cup in 1988/99.

At Italy 1990, all eyes are on Argentina and its brightest star Diego Maradona. Diego comes close to replicating his success from four years ago. With Maradona's ability, Argentina defeats Brazil, Yugoslavia and Italy on its way to the final. Most memorable is the semi-final match between Argentina and Italy played at Diego's club home Naples. To the torment of Maradona, the fans at his own club stadium boo him during the match. Nevertheless, Argentina eliminates Italy after a penalty shootout. The final of the 1990 World Cup, leaves Diego helpless as Argentina are defeated 0-1 by West Germany with a goal from a questionable penalty.
After the loss against West Germany, Maradona's career plummets. In March of 1991, he tested positive for doping and is banned from football for 15 months. Maradona refuses to return back to Napoli after the World Cup incident and transferrs to Sevilla for a year. He eventually goes back to Argentina with Newell's Old Boys.

The 1994 World Cup confirms that Diego's career in international football is over. He is suspended again after failing yet another doping test. Hurt by his absence, Argentina is eventually eliminated by Romania in the second stage.

 Shortly after, Diego takes on a new career path as a coach. He fails miserably again, unable to remain at a single club for more than four months. By 1995, Maradona is forced to return to the game as a player. He goes back to his former club Boca Juniors, and remains there until his last match on 25th of October 1997. Five days later, during his 37th birthday, Maradona announces his retirement from football. Up until 2001, Diego remains away from the playing pitch, periodically entering rehab for cocaine abuse. Diego plays his farewell match on the 10th of November 2001 against a select team comprised by some of the greatest footballers in the game including Ferrara, Suker, Stoichkov, Cantona, Higuita, and Romario. One year earlier, Maradona is voted Best Football Player of the Century by a global Internet poll. Controversy is stirred yet again, by his nearly unanimous victory. FIFA, who find Maradona's personal image as the 'King of Football' unacceptable, decide to give the same award to PelÈ as the Best Footballer for the first half of the century.

PROFILE:
Full name : Daniel Alberto Passarella 
Date of birth : May 25, 1953 (1953-05-25)  
Place of birth  :  Chacabuco, Argentina 
Playing position  : Defender 

Mini Bio:
 Daniel Alberto Passarella, born May 25th 1953, was one of the most commanding sweepers/defenders in World Cup history. He was the perfect leader for any team, and became captain for both club and country at an early age. Despite being only 174cm, he was exceptional in the air and scored an impressive amount of goals by headers from corners or free-kicks. 

 Passarella was an unusual player. His scoring record is quite unique for a defender. In 298 matches in the Argentine league, he scored 99 goals. And when he moved to Italy to play for Fiorentina and later Inter Milan, his goalscoring continued, and he still holds the record in Serie A for goals scored by a defender. Even on international level he scored lots of goals. He won 70 caps for Argentina and scored 22 goals! 

 He won lots of List of few Honours in the game. Several league championships with River Plate in Argentina, which was the club he served most of his career. But the highlight was of course to win the World Cup in 1978 on homesoil. He was 25 years old and captained Argentina to victory. A proud moment for "El Gran Capitan" (The great captain). The final itself was played on Passarella's homeground, Estadio Monumental. Four years later in 1982, Argentina failed to reach the semifinals. A Passarella free-kick against Italy wasn't enough to avoid defeat. 

In Mexico 1986, at 33, he was included in the squad, but got injured and didn't play a minute in the tournament Argentina went on to win. In 1989 he retired playing for his beloved River Plate. He took over as national coach for Argentina in 1994 and led them to the quarterfinals in France 1998 before retiring from the job. 

Following his retirement from playing football, he gained employment at the club, and served as Technical Director at River Plate.

Subsequently, he became the Technical Director of the Argentinian national team, and was in charge of their participation in both the qualifying games and the tournament matches of the World Cup in 1998 in France. Argentina's games were widely criticized in the Argentinian national press and he left his post after the tournament.

He then became Technical Director of Uruguay, whom he left during the qualifying games for the 2002 World Cup, held in Japan and Korea.

In 2003, he won the Mexican football league title with the team Montserrey.

Date of birth  :11 December 1981 (1981-12-11)  
Place of birth : Buenos Aires, Argentina 
Height :1.68 m (5 ft 6 in) 
Playing position : Second Striker

Mini Bio:
Thereís something special about Javier Saviola. He landed at Real Madridís doorstep at the age of 26, which for many footballers is the peak of their careers, having already graced the dressing rooms of River Plate, Barcelona, Monaco, and Sevilla.

The striker has a killer goal-scoring instinct. Short-statured with an angelic face, Saviola is a devil when he gets hold of the ball in his opponentís box. Itís at that moment that the ëRabbití turns into a true predator capable of destroying any defender with his speed and first stride, both of which have earned him comparisons to legendary Brazilian forward Romario.

Saviola always stood out as a member of River Plateís youth system, the same team he debuted with in Argentinaís Primera Division at the age of 16. He scored his first goal in his first match in top flight football and is the youngest player to accomplish such a feat. He would go on to win the 1999 Torneo Apertura as the top scorer of the competition. Only 18-years and one day old, he was the second youngest player to pick up the honor, coming within eight days of Maradonaís record. Saviola also won the following yearís Torneo Clausura. He scored 45 goals in 85 matches with River Plate, plus another ten when including Copa Libertadores action.

Following his first World Cup appearance, and still only 19-years old, Saviola was signed by none other than FC Barcelona. After becoming a naturalized Spanish citizen in 2004, he was sent on loan to AS Monaco, where he played the entire 2004/05 season in the Ligue 1 and the Champions League. Upon returning to Catalonia he was again sent on loan to Sevilla, who went on to win the 2006 UEFA Cup. He returned to Barcelona at seasonís end and in 2007 joined Real Madrid in the Spanish capital.

In 2001 Saviola was named MVP of the FIFA Under-20 World Cup after leading Argentina to the title as the competitions top scorer. He debuted with the Argentine national team on 16 August 2000, a match that ended in a 1-1 draw against Paraguay. He also played in the 2006 World Cup and scored one goal.

Place of birth : La Plata, Argentina 
Height :1.86 m (6 ft 1 in) 
Playing position  : Midfielder 

Mini Bio:
Juan Sebastian Veron (born March 9, 1975 in Buenos Aires) is an Argentine professional football player who plays as a midfielder. Since 2004, he has played for Inter Milan in the Italian top-flight division Serie A.

This experienced midfielder has enjoyed something of a revival in his international career under Diego Maradona's guidance, playing in seven 2010 World Cup qualifiers and emerging as something of a leader in this Argentine pack.

He is the son of Argentina striker Juan RamÛn VerÛn, who was known as La Bruja (The Witch) and who scored against Manchester United in the 1968 World Club Championship at Old Trafford for his club Estudiantes La Plata.

In 1993 La Brujita (Little Witch) signed from school for Estudiantes de La Plata ñ his father's former side. In 1996 he joined Boca Juniors, playing 17 games and scoring three goals. He made his international debut for Argentina, against Poland, in the same year. Sven-Goran Eriksson signed him for Sampdoria shortly afterwards.

In 1998, after starring for Argentina in the World Cup, he signed for Parma in a £15m deal. The following year, Parma won the Coppa Italia. Eriksson then signed him again, this time for Lazio in an £18.1m deal, reportedly netting a weekly wage of £48,000. Coincidentally, he made his debut for Lazio in the Italian side's 2-0 victory over Manchester United in the European Super Cup in Monaco.

In 2000, Veron was the driving force for Lazio as they captured the scudetto, the Coppa Italia and the Italian Super Cup. But in February the following year, the rumours about the validity of his passport caught up with him.

After the 2001 season he moved from Lazio to Manchester United on July 12 for £28.1 million in a five-year deal, the richest transfer in English football at that time. Upon signing for Manchester United, he said he had no fear of the Premiership. Unfortunately, after an impressive start, the pace of the English game started to get the better of him, as some games passed him by, and he was unable to settle into the United midfield. His future at United was constantly debated throughout the season and into the 2002 World Cup, where he again started well, but faded as Argentina fell at the first hurdle.

There was plenty of pressure on him at the start of his second season at Old Trafford, and his performances did seem improve considerably, especially in the Champions League where he scored four goals and was at the heart of United's successes in the group stages. However, injury meant that he missed much of the end of the season, and that may have convinced Sir Alex Ferguson that he could do without the Argentinean.

When Chelsea came in for him following the arrival of billionaire Roman Abramovich, Veron claimed that he wanted to stay and fight for his place at Old Trafford, but Ferguson was willing to let Chelsea talk to him, and he was eventually convinced that his future lay at Stamford Bridge, where he had much to prove. His transfer fee to Chelsea was about half that of his record-breaking transfer of just two years before, signed 4-years-deal, showing both the fall in the transfer market and the decline of his reputation.

Veron made only 14 appearances for Chelsea in the 2003-04 season; he was bothered by a back injury for most of the season. After JosÈ Mourinho took over as manager following the season, Veron became the first casualty of Mourinho's promised cleanout of the Chelsea roster. He was loaned out to Inter, where he found the slow tempo and thoughtful game to his liking much more than the "attack at all costs" mentality of the English Premier League, for the 2004-05 season, and from 24 June 2005 he subsequently returned to Inter on loan for a further two seasons, which finished the contract with Chelsea F.C..

In 2004, he was chosen for the FIFA 100, a list of the 125 greatest living footballers selected by PelÈ as part of FIFA's centenary observances.

El Hadji Diouf was fined two weeks wages by Bolton and was banned for 3 games by the FA after pleading guilty to a charge of improper conduct. De Zeeuw said that spitting in the modern game "shouldn't happen. It is unsportsmanlike, ridiculous and cowardly... I am just very disappointed with him". Diouf's Bolton team-mate Gary Speed said "It's something that you can't defend. To be on the receiving end of that is probably the worst thing that can happen to you. It's something that nobody wants to see in football." Bolton manager Sam Allardyce later revealed that El Hadji Diouf considered sending Diouf to see a sports psychologist.

<p>Kenny Dalglish</p>
<i>
PROFILE:
Full name : Kenneth Mathieson Dalglish 
Date of birth  : 4 March 1951 (1951-03-04)  
Place of birth : Glasgow, Scotland 
Height  : 5 ft 8 in 
Playing position  : Deep-lying forward 

Mini Bio:
Kenneth Mathieson "Kenny" Dalglish (born March 4, 1951) was a Scottish international football player who was born in Glasgow, Scotland. A prolific goalscorer, he was famous for his successes in the 1970s and 1980s, with Glasgow Celtic and with the English club Liverpool, and is widely-regarded as the greatest British player of his generation. More recently, he has also enjoyed success as a club manager: he is one of only a handful of people to have won the English League Championship as a manager with two different clubs. 


Playing career 
Dalglish built his reputation with Celtic, winning the Scottish Championship in five conxsecutive seasons in the early 1970s. He then moved to Liverpool in 1977, for a then-record £440,000 transfer fee, to replace Kevin Keegan, who left to play for Hamburg in Germany. In his first season, Dalglish scored the winning goal in the European Cup final, against the Belgian club F.C. Bruges. He went on to become arguably the most influential member of the most successful club team in English football history, winning further League Championships and European Cups in a period stretching to the mid-1980s. 


Managerial career 
After the Heysel Stadium disaster in 1985, in the wake of the resignation of manager Joe Fagin, Dalglish became player-manager of the club; he coached them to their first-ever "double" ó winning the League Championship and F.A. Cup in the same season ó in his first season, 1985-86. He continued as manager when he retired as a player, winning the League again in 1987/88 and 1989/90, and the F.A Cup in 1988/89. 

Dalglish was also in charge of the club at the time of the Hillsborough disaster, in the 1989 FA Cup semi-final against Nottingham Forest. He won many admirers for his exemplary dignity during this tragedy, and is still well-regarded by Liverpool supporters for this reason as much as for his on-field successes; ultimately, though, the trauma took its toll on his health, and he resigned as manager of Liverpool in 1991. 

Dalglish returned to management after a short break, with Blackburn Rovers, whom he led into the English Premiership in his first season. After winning the Premiership in 1995, Dalglish "moved upstairs" to become Director of Football at Blackburn; this was a largely-symbolic role that freed up his time for golf and TV punditry. He parted company with the club at the end of the following season. 

In Spring 1997 he took control at a third top-flight English club, once again replacing the departing Kevin Keegan, this time as manager of Newcastle United. Despite an initially strong performance, Dalglish's dismantling of one of the most exciting footballing sides in the Premiership lost him the support of the fans, and he was sacked by Newcastle early in the 1997/98 season. 

His most recent role to date was as Director of Football at Celtic, but he resigned after one disastrous season which saw Celtic knocked out of the Scottish FA Cup by Inverness Caledonian Thistle and finish 21 points behind their arch-rivals Rangers in the Scottish Premier League.

Having played for Farul Constanta (1979/1980 and 1982/83), Luceafarul Bucharest (1980/1982), Sportul Studentesc (1983/1986), Steaua Bucharest (1986/1990), Real Madrid (1990/1992), Brescia (1992/1994) and FC Barcelona (1994/1996), Hagi then joined Galatasaray, the Turkish club team that captured the UEFA Cup title in 2000. Prior to his third retirement in 2001, he won 125 international caps, scoring 35 goals.

Hagi made his debut for the national side at the age of 18 in 1983. Since then he has been, literally, the cause of the rise of Romanian soccer in the 1990s. His playing style revolutionized the Romanian game - his speed and creativity made those famous counter-attacks possible. At 5'8" tall, wearing size five boots, Hagi is one of the more diminutive players on the field, but in terms of his impact on the game, and the status of Romanian soccer, he is larger than life. By bringing so much respect to Romanian soccer, Hagi opened up opportunities for future players, as clubs from all over Europe come to scout talent in Romania.

Hagi has since returned to football as a coach. He became the head coach of the Romanian national team in 2001, although he only lasted six months as the team failed to qualify for the 2002 World Cup. He then took over as coach of Turkish first division side Bursaspor but left that club after a disappointing start to the season.

After a 18 month hiatus spent running a coastal Black Sea hotel and appearing in television commercials, he then returned to club management at the helm of the club at which he won his first European trophy, Galatasaray. He resigned from this position, on May 30, 2005, at the end of his first season in the role. For many Galatasaray fans, a third place finish in the League (and therefore missing out on a prestigious berth in the 2005/2006 UEFA Champions League competition) was highly disappointing, despite the club's success in the Turkish Cup.

In November 2005, Gheorghe Hagi took over as manager at FCU Politehnica Timisoara, signing a contract until 2008.

Hagi is ethnically Aromanian. In March 2004, he was named among the top 125 living footballers by Pele. Hagi is Adrian Mutu and Alexandra Mutu's godfather.

<p>George Best</p>

PROFILE:
Full name  :George Best 
Date of birth : 22 May 1946(1946-05-22) 
Place of birth : Belfast, Northern Ireland 
Date of death :  25 November 2005 (aged 59) 
Place of death :  London, England 
Height : 5 ft 9 in
Playing position : Winger,Attacking midfielder 

Mini Bio:
George Best (22 May 1946 ñ 25 November 2005) was a Northern Irish professional football player, best known for his years with Manchester United. He was a winger whose game combined pace, acceleration, balance, two-footedness, goalscoring and the ability to beat defenders. In 1968, his annus mirabilis, he won the European Cup with Manchester United, and was named the European Footballer of the Year. When fit, he was an automatic choice for the Northern Ireland team, but he was unable to lead them to the World Cup qualification, despite being capped 37 times and scoring nine goals.

He was capped 37 times for Northern Ireland, scoring nine goals. Of his nine international goals four were scored against Cyprus and one each against Albania, England, Scotland, Switzerland and Turkey.

On 15 May 1971, Best scored possibly the most famous "goal" of his career at Windsor Park in Belfast against England. As Gordon Banks, the English goalkeeper, released the ball in the air in order to kick the ball downfield, Best managed to kick the ball first, which sent the ball high over their heads and heading towards the open goal. Best outpaced Banks and headed the ball into the empty goal, but the goal was disallowed by referee Alistair Mackenzie.

Best continued to be selected for Northern Ireland throughout the 1970s, despite his fluctuating form and off pitch problems. There were still glimpses of his genius; in 1976, Northern Ireland were drawn against Holland in Rotterdam as one of their group qualifying matches for the 1978 FIFA World Cup. Holland ñ midway between successive World Cup final appearances ñ and Johan Cruyff were at their peak at the time. Five minutes into the game Best received the ball wide on the left. Instead of heading towards goal he turned directly infield, weaved his way past at least three Dutchmen and found his way to Cruyff who was wide right. Best took the ball to his opponent, dipped a shoulder twice and slipped it between Cruyff's feet ñ nutmegging arguably the best player in the world at that time.

Best was considered briefly by manager Billy Bingham for the 1982 World Cup. However, at 36 and with his football skills dulled by age and drink, he was not selected in the Northern Ireland squad.


In 1999, he was voted 11th at the IFFHS European Player of the Century election, and 16th in the World Player of the Century election. Pele named him as one of the 125 best living footballers in his 2004 FIFA 100 list and Best was named 19th, behind Gerd Muller, at the UEFA Golden Jubilee Poll. In his native Northern Ireland, the admiration for him is summed up by the local saying: "Maradona good; PelÈ better; George Best."

He was one of the first celebrity footballers, but his extravagant lifestyle led to problems with alcoholism which curtailed his playing career and eventually led to his death in November 2005 at the age of 59. His cause of death was multiple organ failure brought on by a kidney infection, a side-effect of the immuno-suppressive drugs he was required to take after a liver transplant. In 2007, GQ named him as one of the 50 most stylish men of the past 50 years.

Mini Bio:
Hugo Sanchez Marquez (born July 11, 1958) is a former football striker, considered the best Mexican player ever. He was born in Mexico City and is son of HÈctor S·nchez, who played for Asturias and Atlante.

Beginnings
Being very young he played for the mexican team in the 1975 Panamerican Games and later in the 1976 Olympics. At the age of 18 and with an experience of 80 international games, he signed as a youth player for UNAM Pumas that same year. UNAM managed to get its first championship in the mexican league. Two years later, he became top-scorer in the league, with 26 goals. He also played during the summer for San Diego Shockers.

He played five seasons that were the golden years of UNAM Pumas. In his last season with the team, Hugo S·z became again the top-scorer in a tie with his teammate Cabinho and UNAM got its second championship and the Concacaf cup.

Career in Spain
After five successful seasons in Mexico, with 99 goals to his name, he drew attention of spanish sides, and signed for AtlÈtico de Madrid in 1981. It took him a while to find his feet in this competition, but by 1984-85 season he was scoring regularly with a team that won the Copa del Rey playing the final game versus Athletic Bilbao (with two goals scored by Hugo), a second place in the Spanish League and won the Spanish Super Copa. Hugo got his first Pichichi trophy for maximum scorer in the league.

At this stage, he reached the high-point of his career, signing for Real Madrid in 1985 and playing with players such as Camacho, ButragueÒo, Gordillo, Valdano and MÌchel. This team won five consecutive league titles (from 1985-86 to 1989-90), the Copa del Rey in 1989, and the UEFA cup in 1986. During this time S·nchez gained four consecutive Pichichi trophies.

Place of birth   : Monrovia, Liberia 
Height : 1.84 m  
Playing position : Forward

Mini Bio:
George Manneh Oppong Ousman Weah (born October 1, 1966 in Monrovia) is a Liberian politician and former football forward. He spent 14 years of his professional football career playing for clubs in France, Italy, and England, winning titles in two of the three nations. In 1995, he was named FIFA World Player of the Year, European Footballer of the Year, and African Footballer of the Year. He is commonly regarded as one of the greatest African footballers of all time.Weah has since become a politician in Liberia, and ran unsuccessfully in the 2005 Liberian presidential election, losing to Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf in the second round of voting.

At club level, Weah started his career in his native Liberia, where he represented four clubs (Young Survivors, Bongrange Company, Mighty Barolle Monrovia and Invincible Eleven) before moving to Tonnerre YaoundÈ in Cameroon, where he won the 1988 Cameroon championship. He moved to Europe later in 1988 when he was signed by ArsËne Wenger, (manager of Monaco), who Weah credits as an important influence on his career. At Monaco, Weah was a member of the team who won the French Cup in 1991. In the 1990s Weah played for Paris Saint Germain (1992 - 95), with whom he won the French league in 1994; and AC Milan (1995 - 2000), with whom he won the Italian league in 1996 and 1999.

After leaving Milan in August 1999 Weah moved to Chelsea, Manchester City and Olympique Marseille in quick succession, before leaving Marseille in May 2001 for Al Jazira FC, in the United Arab Emirates.

As successful as he was at club level, Weah was not able to bring over that success to the Liberian national team. He has done everything with the squad from playing to coaching to financing it, but Liberia failed to make a single World Cup, falling a point short in qualifying for the 2002 tournament. This led to Weah being known as one of the best footballers never to have played in a World Cup.


At the 2004 ESPY Awards, he won the Arthur Ashe Courage Award for his efforts. Weah was named by Pele as one of the top 125 greatest living footballers in March 2004. He has been named a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador, a role he suspended while he pursues a political career. Weah has tried to use football as a way to bring happiness and promote education for children in Liberia. In 1998, Weah launched a CD called Lively Up Africa featuring the singer Frisbie Omo Isibor and eight other African football stars. The proceeds from this CD went to children's programmes in the countries of origin of the athletes involved.

Weah is President of the Junior Professionals, a football team he founded in Monrovia in 1994. As a way to encourage young people to remain in school, the club's only requirement for membership is school attendance. Many young people, recruited from all over Liberia, went on to play for the Liberian national team

PROFILE:
Full name : Roy Maurice Keane
Date of birth : 10 August 1971 (1971-08-10) (age 38)
Place of birth : Cork, Ireland
Height :5 ft 10 in 
Playing position : Midfielder

Mini Bio:
Roy Maurice Keane (born 10 August 1971, Cork, Ireland) is an Irish former professional footballer and a manager.

During his playing career Keane was known as one of the greatest to grace the game. He played, notably, for Nottingham Forest, Manchester United and Glasgow Celtic during a sixteen year career. During his time at Manchester United, the club achieved unprecedented success and Keane was the captain of the club from 1997 until his departure in 2005.

He played internationally for the Republic of Ireland, and was captain.

During his first season as Sunderland manager, he took the club from second from last to top of the table. Derby County's defeat to Crystal Palace on April 29, 2007 confirms Sunderland A.F.C.'s promotion to the Premiership.


Club Career

Cobh Ramblers
Roy Keane first played football for local Cork City club Rockmount, before signing for the semi pro club Cobh Ramblers. Playing for Ramblers he was mostly a striker but used to play midfield for the U-21's. It was Ramblers' youth team manager of the time, Eddie O'Rourke, persuaded the Mayfield man to leave the Rockmount team in 1989 and join up with Ramblers.

Roy was one of two Ramblers representatives in the inaugural FAI/FAS scheme in Dublin and it was here he got his first taste of full time training. At the time Roy played for Ramblers' youths' side as well as lining out for the League of Ireland side, often playing twice in the same weekend.

In the tough, physical world of the First Division of the League of Ireland, Roy held his own, his dedication to training noticed by many. It was a mistake in an FAI Youths Cup game by a Ramblers player against Belvedere Boys of Dublin which necessitated a replay in Dublin. The replay was lost 0 - 4. It was the performance of Roy Keane which attracted attention of a Nottingham Forest scout who recommended him to travel for a trial.

Roy suitably impressed the legendary Brian Clough and his staff and in the end a deal worth £47,000 was struck between the two clubs.


Nottingham Forest
In 1989 scouts from Brian Clough's Nottingham Forest took note of his talents and signed him for the sum of £47,000. Keane was quick to impress at Nottingham Forest, making his pro league debut against Liverpool.

By 1991, Keane was a regular in the side, displacing the English international Steve Hodge, and scored three goals during a run to that season's FA Cup final, which Forest ultimately lost to Tottenham Hotspur. A year later Keane returned to Wembley with Forest for the League Cup final but again finished on the losing side as Manchester United gained a 1-0 win.


Manchester United
Man United and Blackburn Rovers competed to sign Keane after Nottingham Forest's relegation in 1993. Manchester United were successful, signing Keane for a then-record £3.75m transfer fee. Keane immediately went into the first team, playing in centre-midfield alongside Paul Ince.

Although he maintains a low profile off the pitch, Keane was involved in numerous controversial incidents while at Man United, earning 11 red cards in the process. In 1995, he was sent off from an FA Cup semi final for stamping on Gareth Southgate, for which he was suspended for three matches and fined £5,000.

After the retirement of …ric Cantona in 1997, Keane became team captain, although he missed most of the 1997/1998 season because of a cruciate ligament injury, caused by an ill timed challenge on Leeds United player Alf Inge Haaland. As Keane lay prone on the ground, Haaland stood over Keane, accusing him of feigning injury. United were top of the league, but their form dropped and finished the season without a trophy.

Keane returned to captain the club to an unprecedented treble in 1999 of the FA Premier League, FA Cup, and UEFA Champions League. One of his finest performances was an inspirational display to help haul his team back from two goals down to win 3 ñ 2 during the semi final second-leg against Juventus, scoring a header to start United's comeback. Earlier in the match Keane received a yellow card to ruled him out of the final after a trip on Zinedine Zidane. United defeated Bayern Munich at Nou Camp 2-1 to win the Champions League, scoring twice in injury time after trailing one nil for most of the match. Keane received a winner's medal though he said he has not looked at it. That year, Keane was named Man of the Match in the finals of the Intercontinental Cup, scoring the only goal of the game as United defeated Palmeiras. As a recognition for his efforts, Keane was voted PFA Players' Player of the Year in 2000.

Keane hit out at sections of United supporters after Man Utd's clash with Dynamo Kiev, at Old Trafford, in the Champions League, 2000. He criticised supporters for booing and jeering the team during the match and accused them of being the Prawn Sandwich Brigade.

In 2001, Keane played against Alf-Inge Haaland for the first time since their clash in 1998, and was sent off for a blatant knee-high foul on Haaland. He initially received a three game suspension. Keane subsequently admitted in an autobiography that he intended to hurt Haaland, which saw him banned for a further five matches and fined £150,000. Haaland retired from football shortly afterwards, stating on his website the cause of this was a recurring problem in his leg, rather than an injury resulting from Keane's tackle.

In 2001-2002, Manchester United finished the season trophyless. Domestically, they were eliminated in the FA Cup by Middlesbrough in the fourth round, and finishing third in the Premiership. They made the semi finals of the UEFA Champions League, their furthest advance since 1999 but they were knocked out by Bayer Leverkusen. After their defeat to Leverkusen, Keane blamed United's loss of form on the playersí Rolexes, the fleets of cars, the multi-millions, and told them they had lost their hunger. (Keane in particular was supposedly to have targeted one of the England players, Wes Brown, or Nicky Butt amongst others.) Earlier in the season, Keane publicly advocated the breakup of The Treble winning team as he believed that his team mates, who played in United's victorious 1999 Champions League final, no longer had a motivation to work as hard.

In August 2002 he was fined two weeks' wages, £150,000, and suspended for three matches for elbowing Sunderland's Jason McAteer. This caused much controversy in the English press as Keane booked himself in for a hip operation and thus would have missed those three matches anyway.

In the 2000s, Keane maintained a healthy rivalry with Arsenal captain Patrick Vieira. The most notable incident was at Highbury in 2005, at the height of an extreme period of bad blood between United and Arsenal, where Vieira was taunting Keane's teammate Gary Neville. Keane afterwards criticised Viera's decision to play internationally for France instead of his birthplace of Senegal.

On 5 February 2005, Keane scored a 50th goal for Man United in a league game against Birmingham City. His appearance in the 2005 FA Cup final (which United lost to Arsenal in a penalty shoot out) was his seventh such game, an all time record.

Overall, Keane lead United to 9 major List of few Honours, making him the most successful captain in the club's history. Keane's trophy haul with Manchester United includes: 7 Premiership titles, 4 FA Cups, a European Cup, and an Intercontinental Cup.

Keane was inducted into the English Football Hall of Fame in 2004 in recognition of his undoubted impact on the English league.

Keane was also picked on the FIFA 100, a list of the greatest living footballers picked by PelÈ.


Departure from Manchester United
Keane unexpectedly left Manchester United on 18 November 2005, during a protracted absence from the team due to injury. He played a last competitive game for Man United in September 2005, which was a 0-0 against rivals Liverpool in which he sustained a broken foot after a challenge with Luis Garcia.

Keane criticised the club's pre season trip to Portugal, branding it unprofessional, which triggered an argument with assistant coach and one-time Real Madrid manager, Carlos Queiroz. Keane is also thought to have blasted Rio Ferdinand, John O'Shea, Alan Smith, Kieran Richardson and, perhaps most notably, Darren Fletcher. The criticism of his fellow players, after an abject 4 ñ 1 defeat at the hands of Middlesbrough, was deemed too damning by United Management, and was subsequently pulled from transmission by the club's TV station, MUTV. Keane's outburst was supported by some Manchester United fans, though it received sterner criticism from fans of other clubs, and media pundits.

Keane had already stated his belief that his contract would be the last with the club and the aforementioned MUTV transmission had frosted relations still further. There had also been rumours of Ferguson threatening to strip him of club captaincy for refusing to apologise for his MUTV outburst, although some of the players concerned had publicly backed him afterwards. He had announced he would leave Utd in the summer of 2006, at the end of his contract with Man United. Many people were expecting Keane to fulfill his boyhood dream of playing in Celtic when he parted ways with his club of 12 years.

His then manager, Sir Alex Ferguson, had said he wanted Keane to succeed him as manager when he retired. In the wake of Keane's public criticism of his own team mates, Ferguson became evasive regarding Keane's prospects as a manager.

Man United reached an agreement with Keane allowing him to leave the club immediately, and offered him a testimonial in recognition of his twelve and a half years at Old Trafford, where the club thanked him for his major contribution as a player and captain. On 30 March 2006, it was announced by Manchester United that Keane's testimonial was to take place on 9 May 2006 and the game would be against Celtic. Man United won the testimonial, 1-0, with the only goal in the game scored by Cristiano Ronaldo. Keane played the first half with Celtic and the second half in his former role as Manchester United captain. The game attracted the largest crowd ever for a testimonial match in England (69,591). Roy Keane's long running favourite charity cause, providing Guide Dogs for the Blind, benefited considerably from the event.


Celtic
On 14 December 2005, the BBC reported that Keane would sign with Celtic, after agreeing to sign a contract in the region of £40,000 per week, and he officially became a Celtic player the following day. The BBC was one agency who reported that they believed his earnings were in the region of £40,000 per week, however Celtic manager Gordon Strachan revealed the player did not want to become an exception to the clubs £25,000 per week wage cap. Celtic Chief Executive Peter Lawall confirmed in the same BBC report Dermot Desmond would not be required to provide any additional funding to the club for the transfer.

Keane's Celtic career began in ignominious fashion as the Glasgow giants crashed to a 2-1 defeat to lowly Clyde in the Scottish Cup third round on 8 January 2006. Keane scored his only Celtic goal a month later in a 2-1 Scottish league victory over Falkirk.

The following Sunday he retained his place and played in his first Old Firm game. Celtic won the match and Keane was accorded the Man of the Match award as the best player. Celtic went on to complete the double of the SPL and Scottish League Cup.

On 12 June, 2006, Roy Keane announced his retirement from professional football on medical advice, only six months after joining Celtic.

<p>Ferenc Puskas</p>

PROFILE:
Full name :Ferenc Purczeld Biro
Date of birth: April 2, 1927(1927-04-02)
Place of birth: Budapest, Hungary
Date of death :November 17, 2006 (aged 79)
Place of death :Budapest, Hungary
Height :1.70 m 
Playing position :Forward

Mini Bio:
Ferenc Puskas was the outstanding player of the marvelous Hungarian national team of the early 1950s. In 1952 they had won Olympic Gold in Helsinki and the "Magical Magyars" arrived at the 1954 FIFA World Cup in Switzerland undefeated in four years.

Their most resounding victory to date had been achieved the previous year when they were the first non-british team to defeat England at Wembley. In one of the great upsets of football history, Hungary were pipped at the post by Germany, with Puskas playing in spite of an injury picked up early on in the tournament.

Puskas fled Hungary in the wake of the Soviet invasion of 1956 and went on to play for Real Madrid well into his 30's. At Madrid he teamed up with the likes of Di Stefano and Gento to win numerous thophies.

Coaching Career:
After retiring as a player, Puskas became a coach and managed teams in Europe, North America, South America, Africa, Asia, and Australia.

The highlight of his coaching career came in 1971 when he guided Panathinaikos of Greece to the European Cup final, the only time a Greek club has reached a European final to date. After beating Everton in the quarter-finals on away goals, Panathinaikos then pulled off the shock of the competition with a dramatic comeback in their semi-final against Red Star Belgrade. 4ñ1 down after the away first-leg, they won the return home second-leg 3ñ0 to qualify for the final on away goals.

The final saw Pusk·s return to Wembley Stadium. Panathinaikos had some memorable chances to score, but eventually lost 2ñ0 to Johan Cruyff's Ajax. During his five-year tenure at Panathinaikos, Pusk·s helped the team secure two Greek Championships and his success with the team made him a cult figure among Panathinaikos fans. With the notable exception of his spell at Panathinaikos, Pusk·s failed to transfer his success as a player to his coaching career.

Despite his wide travels, his only other success came with South Melbourne Hellas, with whom he won the National Soccer League title in 1991.

When Wolverhampton Wanderers opened their new stadium Molineux in 1993, Puskas visited the newly opened stadium as an honorary guest to watch the friendly match between Wolves and Budapest Honved, which was a match to christen the new opening of the stadium. This was because in the 1950s, Wolves played a game against HonvÈd in a memorable friendly match, which Puskas played in. Wolves won the match 3ñ2.

PROFILE:
Full name : Abedi Ayew 
Date of birth : 5 November 1964 (1964-11-05) 
Place of birth : Accra, Ghana 
Height : 1.74 m  
Playing position : Striker

 Mini Bio:
Abedi Pele is one of the great pioneers of African football in Europe. One of the first great African players to make an impact on European club football,he played for teams in Switzerland, Germany, Italy and most famously France where he helped Marseille win the 1993 UEFA Championís League.
 
He was a fixture in the African Championships of the 1980s and 90s with Ghana, though the Black Stars never managed to reach the FIFA World Cup. He has since become one of the continentís most respected and important ambassadors. Abedi Pele is a member of FIFAís Football Committee. 

As a 17-year old he had helped Ghana win the Nations Cup in 1982 but his efforts to lead the team to a similar triumph as captain in the 90's were of no luck. 1992, when they reached the finals, he was suspended because of two yellow cards and had to watch his team losing on penalties. 

Abedi holds the CAF Cup as the player who has been at the Nations Cup Finals more than any other on the continent, beating even the legendary Roger Milla of Cameroon to the record. He made his first appearance at the 13th Nations Cup Finals in Libya in 1982 and for the next 16 years (ending at the 21st Finals in Burkina) continued to grace the most prestigious football fiesta on the continent, first as a member of Ghana's squad rising to become captain in 1990, as captain. 

Abedi's brilliant exploits on the field took him to France, Italy, Germany and the Middle East, where he attracted millions of fans. He was very instrumental in Olympic Marseilles winning the European Club Championship trophy in 1993, the first time a French team won it. 

Abedi Pele left Ghana after the `82 African Cup to Qatar. He had a short spell with F.C. Zurich in Swiss. He returned to Ghana and after both Kotoko and Hearts failed to signed him he joined Dragons of Benin for a short spell. He finally returned to Ghana and played for RTU for a season. He left to start his career in France with Chamois Noirt, then Montpellier, then Lille before he moved to Olympique Marsielle. He later joined Lyon, then Torino before finishing his European sojourn with 1860 Munich. 

Pele has the singular honour of participating in more FIFA organized charity matches than any African player. He is currently on the player status committees of both FIFA and CAF. 

Pele is adored in many African countries, especially the Francophone countries because of his exploits in France. 

Nevertheless, in countries such as Nigeria and South Africa, football fans still wear T-shirts bearing his name. In fact, Abedi is indeed a goodwill soccer ambassador of Africa. That explains why the South African FA made him a Spokesperson for their 2006 World Cup bid. 

In appreciation of Abedi's devout services to the country, the Ghanaian government awarded him the country's highest honour, the Order of the Volta (civil division). He thus becomes the first Ghanaian sportsman to be so honoured. 

However, among his many awards, the one Abedi would like to forget is the European Cup medal he won with the French side Olympique de Marseilles which was later withdrawn by Uefa after Marseilles' owner Bernard Tapie had been found guilty of cheating and other malpractices. 

He was in June 2001 nominated by the present government of Ghana to serve as the next Chairman of the FA, an opportunity he later gave up for a more experienced former coach of Ghana for which in his own words said that this was to be an opportunity to learn from his superiors.

He at present owns a club with the future hopes of nurturing the young talent to augment the fledging league of the country.

<p>Roger Milla</p>

PROFILE:
Full name  : Albert Roger Mooh Miller 
Date of birth : May 20, 1952 (1952-05-20)  
Place of birth : Yaounde, Cameroon 
Height : 6 ft 1 in 
Playing position : Forward 

Mini Bio:
Roger Milla (born Albert Roger Miller, May 20, 1952, Yaounde) is a former Cameroonian football player. He is one of the first African players to be a major star on the international stage. Amazingly, he did not achieve international stardom until he was 38, an age at which most other footballers have long since retired.

Born in the Cameroonian capital of Yaounde, he moved constantly as a child because of his father's railroad job. He signed for his first club in Douala as a 13-year-old. At 18, he won his first league championship with another Douala club; in 1976, by which time he had moved to Tonnerre Yaounde, he was awarded the African Golden Ball.

In 1977, he was lured to Europe by the French club Valenciennes. However, he was kept on the reserves for two years. In 1979, he joined AS Monaco, but shuttled between the reserves' bench and the injury list. The next year, he joined Bastia, but still did not flourish. He finally found stardom at Saint-Etienne in 1984; he then starred for Montpellier from 1986 to 1989, and became a member of the club's coaching staff after retiring from French football.

While playing in France, he made his first appearance for the Cameroon national team (in 1978). He was a member of Cameroon's team at the 1982 World Cup, having a good goal wrongly disallowed against Peru in their first match. He played well as Cameroon went out with three draws from their three first-round games. Two years later, he was part of the squad competing at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, California. He first retired from international football in 1987, and eventually moved to RÈunion in the Indian Ocean for his retirement.

However, in 1990, he received a phone call from the President of Cameroon, who pleaded with him to come out of retirement and rejoin the national team. He agreed, and went to Italy with the Indomitable Lions for the World Cup.

Milla emerged as one of the tournament's major stars. He scored four goals in Italy, celebrating each one with a dance around the corner post that has become a popular goal celebration ever since. Two of his goals came against Romania in Cameroon's second game, and two more came in extra time against Colombia in the last 16 to carry Cameroon to the quarter-finals -- the furthest that an African team has ever advanced at the World Cup (Senegal matched this feat in 2002).

Milla returned to the 1994 World Cup at the age of 42 (during the tournament, a member of the Cameroon delegation remarked to journalists that Milla was in fact aged 46!). In the USA, Cameroon was knocked out in the group stages; however, Milla scored the consolation prize of a goal against Russia, breaking his own record as the oldest goalscorer in a World Cup tournament.

He is now an itinerant ambassador for African causes. In 2004, he was named to the FIFA 100, a list of the 125 greatest living footballers selected by PelÈ in conjunction with FIFA's centenary celebrations.

In 2006, Milla was chosen for best African player of the last century, ending up ahead of El Khatib and Hassan. The election was held by the CAF, the African football association.

PROFILE:
Full name : Hristo Stoichkov Stoichkov 
Date of birth : February 8, 1966 (1966-02-08) 
Place of birth : Plovdiv, Bulgaria 
Height :1.78 m 
Playing position : Winger / Forward

Mini Bio:
Hristo Stoichkov was born on February 8, 1966 in Plovdiv, Bulgary. He is a famous football player.
 
Hristo Stoichkov (at times written Stoitchkov) is the most successful Bulgarian soccer player of all time. He debuted in professional football with CSKA Sofia and was later spotted by European giant FC Barcelona. Stoitchkov earned global acclaim after winning the Spanish Primera Division four consecutive times and taking his club to Champions League glory in 1992. At World Cup 1994, Hristo Stoichkov was awarded the Golden boot as the top goal scorer of the tournament as he miraculously led his country to the 
semi-finals.

Apart from his numerous awards and trophies, Hristo Stoichkov gained much popularity because of his aggressive on-pitch temper. His relentless attitude was known to irritate his opposition and enthrall his fans who preserve his image close to their hearts.

As a player, Hristo Stoitchkov plays as a left attacker/winger. His specialties include free kicks, penalties and taking unpredictable shots on goal. Stoichkov is also known for his explosive acceleration and speed dribbling.

At the 1994 World Cup, Stoichkov was awarded the Golden Boot as the joint top goal scorer of the tournament (with Oleg Salenko), with six goals. He led Bulgaria past Germany to the semi-finals, where they lost 2ñ1 to Italy. They subsequently lost the third place play-off to Sweden, 4ñ0.

Bulgaria finished second in the qualifying group for Euro 1996 after the first place was taken by the eventual winners, Germany. Stoichkov scored 10 goals for his team during the qualifiers, as Bulgaria qualified as one of the best 6 runners-up. In the first match against Germany in Sofia, Bulgaria were 2ñ0 down at half-time. Stoichkov equalized with two goals from penalties and Emil Kostadinov also scored for a 3ñ2 win. Bulgaria lost the second match in Germany 3ñ1.

During the finals, Bulgaria lost 3ñ1 in the decisive group match against a very strong France side (the future World Champions); at the same time, in the other match, Spain won 2ñ1 late on against Romania and so the Bulgarians went out. In that tournament, Stoichkov scored 3 goals in 3 matches, and another goal against Spain was disallowed for offside, though action replays show that he was actually on-side. Stoitchkov was the only player to score from a free kick (against France) in this tournament.

He was also part of the squad that was eliminated in the first round of the 1998 World Cup. Bulgaria was not nearly as strong as in previous years, earning only one point in a 0ñ0 draw against Paraguay and scoring only one goal through Kostadinov in a 6ñ1 defeat by Spain in the so-called "Group of Death".

Stoichkov retired from internationals in 1999 with 37 goals in 83 appearances. Subsequently he was the coach of the Bulgarian national team from 2004 to April 2007.

In November 2003, to celebrate UEFA's Jubilee, he was selected as the Golden Player of Bulgaria by the Bulgarian Football Union as their most outstanding player of the past 50 years.

Rustu was named the best goalkeeper in European competitions in 2002, selected for the 2002 UEFA Team Of The Year by public vote. In 2004, he was selected to FIFA 100 by Pele as one of the 125 best living footballers in the world. Rustu retired from international level after UEFA Euro 2008 with 119 international caps to his name but was called to play against Spain on 28 March 2009 and 1 April.

FIFA World Cup 2002
Turkey finished third in the 2002 FIFA World Cup, with Rustu one of the impressing players making his way into the "Team of the Tournament". The tournament had enhanced his reputation and Rustu caught the attention of the big European clubs. However, Rustu had made a promise to the Fenerbahce fans before the World Cup that he would see out his contract, which ended after the 2002-03 season.

 Euro 2008
With Turkey's first choice goalkeeper Volkan Demirel suspended, Rustu started their quarter-final match against Croatia. He was the captain of the team for the final handful of minutes due to substitution of injured Nihat Kahveci. A questionable foray from his goalmouth allowed Croatia to score the match's first goal with a minute remaining in extra time. Rustu immediately made amends for his mistake though, assisting on Semih senturk's injury time goal in the 122nd minute. In the ensuing penalty shootout, he faced four kicks, saving the last one to secure Turkey's victory in the shootout and enabling Turkey to progress to the Euro semi-finals for the first time ever. In the aftermath of the semi-final game with Germany, he announced his retirement from the national team. However, he was since called up against Spain for a 2010 FIFA World Cup qualifying match

Mini Bio:
Pavel Nedved was born in the town of Cheb, near Prague, the capital of former Czechoslovakia. Parents Vaclav and Ana raised Pavel along with his older sister and encouraged him to become an accountant. By the age of 19, Nedved debuted with Dukla Praga and less than a season later he was recruited by rivals Sparta. 

Biography and Career :

For Pavel Nedved success also came promptly and the club took three consecutive league titles between 1992 to 1995. 

Pavel Nedved's consistent performances earned him a spot in the national squad of the Czech Republic and in June 1994 he debuted at a 3-1 victory over Ireland.

Pavel Nedved was instrumental in his country's silver medals at Euro 1996. This gave him the international exposure needed for transfer in a big club. After the tournament, he was purchased by Lazio. 

In Rome, Pavel Nedved won the Coppa Italia in 1998 and the 1999 Cup Winners' Cup against Mallorca. By 2001, Pavel Nedved's presence was significantly felt in Italy as well as across Europe. The Czech scored regularly in club competition and his work rate was startling even at the international level. 

This did not go unnoticed attracting Italian grand Juventus, which at that time had just sold their star playmaker Zidane. In 2001, Juve paid 41.2 Million Euro for Pavel Nedved. He quickly assumed the role of an engine in his new team, compensating with tenacity for the missing Zidane. Pavel's efforts played a big role as Juventus won the Scudetto in 2001/02 and 2002/03. In the 2002/03 season, Juve reached the Champions League final with Nedved scoring five goals along the way. Ironically, the Czech missed the final match due to an accumulation of yellow cards and his team lost at penalties. Even although Juventus did not take the Champs League trophy, Nedved was so impressive in his efforts during the 2002/03 season that UEFA made the rare decision to award him the Golden Ball as the top European footballer.

Pavel Nedved is renowned for his tremendously high work rate and dedication. He has good vision and applies himself across the entire pitch. 

Pavel Nedved's skills are also above average. He can efficiently dribble, pass and has a fierce long-range shot. Calcio defenders often take him down because they can't prevent him from winning 50-50 battles through his pace.

Pavel Nedved is very combative and often produces turnovers for his team. Few are the players like Pavel Nedved who possess both physical prowess and good ball skills

PROFILE:
Full name : Ivan Luis Zamorano Zamora 
Date of birth : January 18, 1967 (1967-01-18)  
Place of birth :Santiago, Chile 
Height :1.78 m (5 ft 10 in) 
Playing position : Striker 

Mini Bio:
Ivan Zamorano (born January 18, 1967), often nicknamed Bam Bam (after The Flintstones character) and Iv·n el Terrible (Ivan the Terrible), was an association football player from Chile who played internationally in clubs like Sevilla FC and Real Madrid (Spain), Internazionale (Italy) and Club AmÈrica (Mexico).

In 1995 Zamorano's playing skills made Real Madrid champion of the Spanish League, and for his 27 goals in the season he was awarded with the Pichichi as top scorer.

Zamorano retired from competition in late 2003, after a career spanning more than 16 years. For Chile, Zamorano played 69 times, scoring 34 goals. He played for his country at the 1998 World Cup.

In 2004, Zamorano was selected among the FIFA 100 best living soccer players in the world, a list compiled by soccer virtuoso Pele.

Zamorano is a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador to Chile.

Zamorano is currently working as an assistant coach with the Chilean Under-18 national football team; many speculate that he is being groomed to take charge of the Chile national football team at some point in the future. Polls have indicated that Zamorano would be a popular choice with the Chilean public.

Facts:
Zamorano was nicknamed Bam Bam (for Bamm-Bamm, a character from The Flintstones), and Ivan el Terrible ("Ivan the Terrible").
Zamorano wore the number 9 jersey for Internazionale until a sponsorship deal with Nike saw Ronaldo given the traditional strikers' number. When this happened, they gave him the number 18 jersey, but Zamorano added a plus (+) sign between the two numbers (actually, 1+8=9).
Zamorano was the promotional face of the new Santiago, Chile transport system Transantiago, which has brought him criticism because of the system's starting failures; some even say his credibility may have been damaged.

Among one of Ceulemans' finest achievements was captaining his national side to fourth place in the 1986 FIFA World Cup, scoring three goals in the tournament including a beautiful diving header against Spain in the quarter-finals. His performance earned the nickname "Captain Courageous". He retired from international competition after the 1990 FIFA World Cup; Jan scored the 3rd goal in a 3-1 win over Uruguay but Belgium was eliminated by England in the round of sixteen, with the winning goal being scored by David Platt in the 119th minute in extra time.

Mini Bio:
Franky Van der Elst (born April 30, 1961 in Ninove) is a former Belgian footballer and a current manager.

A defensive midfielder, he played mainly with Club Brugge, being regarded as a legend there, and briefly coaching the team in the 2000's.

Van der Elst started his professional career at R.W.D. Molenbeek, earning his first call-up for Belgium in 1982. Two years later, he moved to Club Brugge KV and stayed there until he finished his career in 1999, going on to total over 500 overall appearances with the side (462 in the league alone). During four seasons, he often partnered in midfield his namesake Leo - no relation.

Van der Elst won the Golden Shoe twice in his career, an accomplishment for an eminently defensive-minded player. He also appeared in four World Cups, from 1986 to 1998. Only having scored once for his country in nearly 90 matches, against Norway, he reacted with astonishment upon its realization.

After his career as a player, Van der Elst was appointed as manager at Germinal Beerschot Antwerpen. After four relatively successful years, he was replaced by Marc Brys, and subsequently joined K.S.C. Lokeren Oost-Vlaanderen, however only for one season.

In 2005, Van der Elst returned to 'his' Club Brugge, as an assistant, joining former teammates (both in club and country) Jan Ceulemans, Marc Degryse, Dany Verlinden and RenÈ Verheyen. He stayed at Brugge when Verheyen and Ceulemans were fired in 2006, but was eventually shown the door the following year, with head coach Emilio Ferrera.

After a very short spell with FC Brussels, Van der Elst moved to K.V.S.K. United Overpelt-Lommel, both sides in the second level.

PROFILE:
Full name	: Marcos Evangelista de Moraes
Date of birth : June 7, 1970 
Place of birth : Sao Paulo, Brazil
Height: 1.76 m
Playing position: Right back

Mini Bio:
Marcos Evangelista de Moraes (born 7 June 1970), better known as Cafu, is a former Brazilian footballer who is widely regarded as one of the greatest right-backs ever. He was given this nickname due to his speed up and down the right flank which was reminiscent of Cafuringa, a Brazilian forward from the 1970s.

Cafu is the most-capped Brazilian player of all time with 143, including 21 World Cup finals appearances. He has won two World Cups in 1994 and 2002, and is one of the few players that have participated in four consecutive tournaments, as well as being the first and to this day the only player to participate in three consecutive WC final matches. He earned his first cap in a friendly against Spain on 12 September 1990, and played sparingly for Brazil in the early 90s, making the 1994 World Cup roster as a substitute. He appeared in the final against Italy, following an injury to Jorginho in the 22nd minute. After that, Cafu was soon a regular in the starting eleven as Brazil won the Copa AmÈrica in 1997 and 1999, and reached the 1998 FIFA World Cup final.

Brazil endured a rocky qualification for the 2002 tournament, during which Cafu came under heavy criticism from coach Wanderley Luxemburgo, who stripped him of the team captaincy after he was sent off in a qualifier against Paraguay. Shortly after that, though, Luxemburgo was out of a job, and replacement Luiz Felipe Scolari made Emerson his new choice for captain. However, Emerson missed the cut after he dislocated his shoulder in training, which allowed Cafu to regain the armband. After Brazil defeated Germany 2ñ0 in the final match, he stood on the victory podium during the postmatch celebration and, as he raised the trophy, shouted to his wife, "Regina, eu te amo!" ("Regina, I love you!").

Cafu and Brazil fell short of high expectations placed on the squad four years later in 2006, as the SeleÁ„o meekly exited in the quarterfinals after a 1ñ0 defeat by France. Coach Carlos Alberto Parreira was criticized for featuring fading veterans, most notably the 36-year-old Cafu and 33-year-old Roberto Carlos, in the starting eleven in lieu of younger players. Cafu was one of only a few Brazil players who spoke to the press in the midst of a hailstorm of criticism from Brazilian fans and media alike following the team's return home. He nonetheless expressed interest in participating in the 2010 FIFA World Cup, where he would be 40 years old. However, he has since retired from football altogether.

Cafu was named by Pele as one of the top 125 greatest living footballers in March 2004.

Height :1.73 m

Mini Bio:
Edison Arantes do Nascimento,  (born 23 October 1940), best known by his nickname Pele is a retired Brazilian football player. While his birth certificate shows his first name as Edison, He is widely regarded by polls among football experts, former players and fans as the greatest footballer of all time.

Pele was the greatest soccer player ever, scoring over 1200 goals in a glittering career that also brought World Cup and World Club Championships. The biography of Pele is a tough act to follow for any modern world cup players !

When soccer fans talk about the greatest player of all time you will debate the skills of Pele, Maradona, Best and some other soccer legends but can anyone match the amazing biography of Pele ? Pele scored an amazing 1281 goals in a career that covered 1360 games ! That is nearly an average of one goal per game !

History of Pele

Pele was a nickname from childhood as the Brazilian soccer star's real name was Edson Arantes do Nascimento, the nickname originated from school . Pele was the youngest player ever to win a soccer world cup winners medal when Brazil won the 1958 world cup as a 17 year old. Pele scored 2 goals in the world cup final at the age of 17 , an achivement that is unlikely to be matched ever in world cup history.

Pele was brought up in a poor part of Brazil and was guided by his father who was also a professional soccer player, his father once scored five headed goals in the one match ! . Pele played for Santos of Brazil and was part of the winning 1962 and 1963 Inter Continential championship winning squad ( World Club Championship ) .

Pele was also part of the 1962 world cup winning squad but injury hampered his appearances and this was also the case in the 1966 England world cup as some brutal tactics put him out of the tournament and Brazil also failed to retain their trophy.

1958 World Cup
His first match in the World Cup was against USSR in the first round of the 1958 FIFA World Cup. He was the youngest player of that tournament, and at the time the youngest ever to play in the World Cup.He scored his first World Cup goal against Wales in quarterfinals, the only goal of the match, to help Brazil advance to semifinals, while becoming the youngest ever World Cup goalscorer at 17 years and 239 days. Against France in the semifinal, Brazil was leading 2ñ1 at halftime, and then PelÈ scored a hat-trick, becoming the youngest in World Cup history to do so.

On 19 June 1958 Pele became the youngest player to play in a World Cup final match at 17 years and 249 days. He scored two goals in the final as Brazil beat Sweden 5ñ2. His first goal, a lob over a defender followed by a precise volley shot, was selected as one of the best goals in the history of the World Cup. When the match ended, he passed out on the field, and had to be attended by the medical staff. He then recovered, and was visibly compelled by the victory, in tears as being congratulated by his teammates. He finished the tournament with six goals in four matches played, tied for second place, behind record-breaker Just Fontaine.

1962 World Cup
In the first match of the 1962 World Cup, against Mexico, Pele assisted on the first goal and then scored the second one to go up 2ñ0 after a run past four defenders. He injured himself while attempting a long-range shot against Czechoslovakia.This would keep him out of the rest of the tournament, and forced coach AymorÈ Moreira to make his only lineup change of the tournament. The substitute was Amarildo, who performed well for the rest of the tournament. Yet it was Garrincha who would take the leading role and carry Brazil to their second World Cup title.

1966 World Cup
The 1966 World Cup was marked among other things for its brutal fouling on Pele by the Bulgarian and Portuguese defenders. Brazil was eliminated in the first round, playing only three matches. Pele scored the first goal from a free kick against Bulgaria, but due to his injury, a result of persistent fouling by the Bulgarians, he was left out for the second game against Hungary. Brazil lost that game and Pele, although still recovering was brought back for the last crucial match against Portugal. In that game Joao Morais brutally fouled Pele, but was allowed to stay on field by referee George McCabe. PelÈ had to stay in the field limping for the rest of the game, since substitutes were not allowed at that time. After this game he vowed he would not play again in the World Cup, a decision he would later change.

1970 World Cup
When Pele was called to the national team in early 1969, he first refused, but then accepted and played in six World Cup qualifying matches, scoring six goals. The 1970 World Cup in Mexico was to be Pele's last. Brazil's squad for the tournament featured major changes in relation to the 1966 squad. Players like Garrincha, Nilton Santos, Djalma Santos, and Gilmar had already retired, but the team, with Pele, Rivelino, Jairzinho, Gerson, Tostao, and Clodoaldo, is widely considered one of the greatest football teams ever.

In the first match, against Czechoslovakia, Pele gave Brazil a 2ñ1 lead after controlling Gerson's long pass with his chest. In this match, Pele audaciously attempted to lob goalkeeper Ivo Victor from the half-way line, only narrowly missing the Czech goal. Brazil went on to win the match, 4ñ1. In the first half of the match against England, he nearly scored with a header that was spectacularly saved by Gordon Banks. In the second half, he assisted Jairzinho for the only goal of the match. Against Romania, he opened the score on a direct free kick goal, a strong strike with the outside of his right foot. Later on the match he scored again to put the score 3ñ1. Brazil won by a final score of 3ñ2. In quarterfinals against Peru, Brazil won 4ñ2, with Pele assisting Tostao on his team's third goal. In the semi-finals, Brazil faced Uruguay for the first time since the 1950 World Cup final round match. Jairzinho put Brazil ahead 2ñ1, and Pele assisted Rivelino for the 3ñ1. During that match, PelÈ made one of his most famous plays. Tostao gave Pele a through ball, and Uruguay's goalkeeper Ladislao Mazurkiewicz took notice of it. The keeper ran off of his line to get the ball before Pele, but Pele got there first, and without touching the ball, he caused it to go past the keeper, to the latter's left, while Pele went right. Pele went around the goalkeeper and took a shot while turning towards the goal, but he turned in excess as he shot, and the ball drifted just wide of the far post.

Brazil played Italy in the final, with Pele scoring the opener on a header over defender Tarcisio Burgnich. He then made assists on Jairzinho's and Carlos Alberto's goals, the latter one after an impressive collective play. Brazil won the match 4ñ1, keeping the Jules Rimet Trophy indefinitely. Burgnich, who marked PelÈ during the match, was quoted saying "I told myself before the game, he's made of skin and bones just like everyone else ó but I was wrong".

Pele's last international match was on 18 July 1971 against Yugoslavia in Rio de Janeiro. With Pele on the field, the Brazilian team's record was 67 wins, 14 draws, and 11 losses, and went on to win three World Cups. Brazil never lost a match while fielding both Pele and Garrincha.
South American Championship

Pele also played in the South American Championship. In the 1959 competition he was top scorer with eight goals, as Brazil came second in the tournament.

<p>Rivaldo</p>
<i>
PROFILE:
Full name	: VÌtor Borba Ferreira
Date of birth: 19 April 1972 
Place of birth : Paulista, Brazil
Height: 1.86 m 
Playing position : Attacking midfielder

Mini Bio:
Rivaldo Vitor Borba Fereira was born on the 19th of April 1972 in the Recife town of Brazil. 

Rivaldo  lost his father at a car accident the age of eight, his fatherís dream was to see his sons play football. Rivaldo had an extremely poor upbringing in the favelas of the port town of Recife. His physical appearance still marks the poverty he experienced in his childhood: malnourishment caused bowleggedness and the loss of several teeth. 

Rivaldo, is regarded as one of the best Brazilian professional football players of all time, currently playing for AEK Athens in the Super League Greece.

Pele named Rivaldo in his 125 Greatest Living Footballers at a FIFA Awards Ceramony.


Rivaldo signed professional terms at the age of 16 in 1989 with Santa Cruz after impressing local scouts in a junior tournament. He joined Brazilian first division club Mogi-Mirim in 1991.

Rivaldo signed for Corinthians in 1993 and made his international debut in December 1993, scoring the only goal in 1-0 victory over Mexico in a friendly international.

Rivaldo signed for Palmeiras in 1994 and won the Brazilian league championship on the same year. He won the S„o Paulo state championship with Palmeiras in 1996.
Rivaldo In Europe

 Rivaldo  moved to Spain in 1996 and joined Deportivo La CoruÒa. Rivaldo then transferred to Barcelona in August 1997. 

In his first season at Barcelona, he was the second best goal scorer with 19 goals in 34 matches, as Barcelona won The Double of La Liga championship and Copa del Rey.

Winning a second Spanish league title with Barcelona in 1999, Rivaldo won both FIFA and World Soccer magazine's World Player of the Year awards. He was voted European Footballer of the Year by France Football magazine.

In June 2002, BarÁa decided to release Rivaldo from his contract a year before it was due to expire and he signed a three-year contract with the Italian Serie A club A.C. Milan. He left the star-studded Milan after a season of very few starts. 


After a brief stint back in Brazil with Cruzeiro (11 games played, 2 goals scored), Rivaldo signed with Olympiacos for the 2004-05 season and won the Greek championship and the Greek cup (23 games played, 12 goals scored).

Rivaldo scored some memorable goals in his first season at Olympiacos, including a fantastic effort in the cup final with a well placed lob from a difficult position close to corner flag. Rivaldo also scored 2 memorable free kicks during the season, the first was in the local derby vs the other Athens giant, Panathinaikos and the second against English club Liverpool in the UEFA Champions League.

On May 12, 2007, Olympiacos offered him a lower contract and Rivaldo announced that he would leave Olympiacos over failed contract extension talks and neglectful management. After more than 2 weeks of negotiations, Rivaldo signed on with the Super League club AEK FC on May 29, 2007, making the acquisition arguably the best in AEK's history. In AEK Rivaldo will play under his former Barcelona FC manager LlorenÁ Serra Ferrer. Rivaldo finished his Olympiakos career with 43 goals in 81 games played.

Between 1993 and 2003, Rivaldo played 74 matches and scored 34 goals for the Brazil national football team and he was a very influential part of the 2002 FIFA World Cup winning Brazilian team. 

An attacking midfielder, he is known for his play-making capabilities, as well as his technique. He is also known for his bicycle kicks.

PROFILE:
Full name	: Roberto Rivelino
Date of birth : 1 January 1946 
Place of birth : Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil
Playing position : Midfielder

Mini Bio:
Roberto Rivelino (b. January 1st, 1946 - Sao Paulo) is a Brazilian football player, famous for his extremely potent left-foot shot, thunderous long-range free kicks and large moustache. He also invented a soccer move called the "Elastico", also known as "flip flap". He is widely regarded as one of the most graceful footballers ever, and is usually ranked as the 4th best Brazilian, after Pele, Garrincha, and Zico, respectively, as well as one of the best midfielders the world's ever seen.

Rivelino, as he is most commonly known in Brazil, started as a futsal player in Clube Indiano, Sao Paulo. His first professional club was Sport Club Corinthians Paulista, one of the most important Brazilian soccer teams. Unfortunately for him, when he played for Corinthians, the club was in one of the worst state of its history. After losing the 1974 S„o Paulo State championship to Corinthians' arch-rival, Palmeiras, Rivelino was ostracized by the majority of Corinthians' supporters, and left the club to play for Fluminense in Rio de Janeiro. Among the cariocas, Rivelino was also an idol, winning the Carioca State Championship in 1975 and 1976. Towards the end of the seventies, Rivelino went to play in Saudi Arabia; he retired in 1981.

He scored 165 goals for Corinthians.

Rivelino is also one of the players that have more than 100 caps for the Brazilian national team. He was a starter in most games in the successful Brazilian campaign in the 1970 World Cup, scoring 3 goals, including the powerful free-kick against Czechoslovakia, which earned him the nickname "patada atomica" by Mexican fans. Rivelino also played in the 1974 and 1978 World Cups, although with less success (4th and 3rd places respectively).

After his professional retirement, Rivelino started a career as a soccer commentator and coach (he has directed the Japanese national team).

Rivelino was one of the players named by Pele in 2004 as the 125 Greatest Living Footballers.

Rivelino is sometimes credited with scoring the fastest goal in football history when he supposedly scored a goal direct from the kick-off after noticing the opposition goalkeeper on his knees finishing off pre-match prayers.

PROFILE:

Date of birth : April 21, 1973 
Place of birth : Garca, Sao Paulo, Brazil
Height : 1.68 m 
Playing position : Left wingback

Mini Bio:
Roberto Carlos da Silva Rocha (born 10 April 1973 in Garca, Sao Paulo, Brazil) commonly known as simply Roberto Carlos, is a Brazilian footballer. He was a member of the Brazil national team in three World Cups, helping the team reach the final in 1998 and win the 2002 tournament. He is also known for his trademark free kicks, explosive running speed and powerful curling banana trajectory shot.

Roberto Carlos plays for Corinthians in Brazil. Previously he played for Spanish club Real Madrid for 11 years, winning four leagues, three UEFA Champions League trophies, and two Intercontinental Cups. He is also one of only six players to have played more than 100 matches in the Champions League, as of February 2008. He finished second to countryman Ronaldo in the 1997 FIFA World Player of the Year award poll and was named as one of the top 125 greatest living footballers by PelÈ in March 2004. EncyclopÊdia Britannica heralds Roberto Carlos as "an excellent exponent of the wing back position."

Roberto Carlos amassed 125 caps, scoring 11 goals for the Brazilian national team. At the 1998 FIFA World Cup, he played seven matches, including the final loss to France. After a qualifying game for the 2002 FIFA World Cup, Paraguay goalkeeper JosÈ Luis Chilavert spat on Roberto Carlos, an action which caused FIFA to give Chilavert a three-match suspension and forced him to watch the first game of the World Cup from the stands. Roberto Carlos also played seven matches in the finals, scoring a goal from a free kick against China. He also was a starter in the final against Germany, with Brazil winning 2ñ0.

He is especially famous for a free kick against France in the inaugural match of Tournoi de France 1997 on 3 June 1997. He shot from 35 m (115 ft) from the centre-right channel, and scored. The ball curved so much that the ball boy 10 yards to the right ducked instinctively, thinking that the ball would hit him. Instead, it eventually curled back on target, much to the surprise of goalkeeper Fabien Barthez, who just stood in place.

In July 2006, after Brazil's 1-0 defeat to France in the 2006 FIFA World Cup quarter-finals, Roberto Carlos announced his retirement from the national team, saying, "I've stopped with the national team. It was my last game." He said he no longer wanted to play for Brazil because of the criticism he faced from fans and Brazilian media for his failure to mark goal scorer Thierry Henry on France's winning goal. Upon signing with Corinthians in January 2010, Roberto Carlos told TV Globo that he hoped to play at the 2010 FIFA World Cup and believed his return to Brazilian football may help him return to the national team, as manager Dunga had yet to settle on a left back.

<p>Romario</p>
<i>
PROFILE:
Full name	 : Romario de Souza Faria
Date of birth : January 29, 1966 
Place of birth : Rio de Janeiro, Brazil
Height : 1.69 m 
Playing position : Striker

Mini Bio:
Romario de Souza Faria (born January 29, 1966 in Rio de Janeiro), better known simply as Romario, is a Brazilian football player. He is one of a select group of players with over 50 goals in international matches and one of Brazil's most famous and outstanding forwards. He is considered to be one of the greatest footballers in the history of the game.

Romario is the 2nd highest scorer in the history of professional football, being surpassed only by Pele. On January 28, 2006, one day before his fortieth birthday, he scored his 950th goal (official FIFA count). He is pursuing the 1.000 "One-Thousand" goal, a mark obtained only by 1 other player in history: Pele.

He started his career playing for Vasco da Gama, where he won two State Championships (1987/88). Between 1988 and 1992 he played for PSV Eindhoven, who won the Dutch League in 1989, 1991 and 1992. In 1993 he moved to FC Barcelona and won the Spanish League the same year. As a member of the Brazilian national team, Rom·rio won the silver Olympic medal in Seoul in 1988. Partnering with Bebeto in the attack, he led his country to the 1994 World Cup title, scoring five goals in the tournament. He was voted the most outstanding player of the tournament and captured the imagination of soccer fans everywhere with his incredible skill and touch. Romario was named FIFA World Player of the Year in 1994, after being the runner-up in 1993. In 1995 he returned to Brazil to play for Flamengo, spent the next year in Valencia.. In 1998, he missed out the World Cup due to injury and then returned to Flamengo until 1999.

He played for Vasco da Gama again, winning with them the Mercosur Cup and the Brazilian League in 2000. From 2002 until 2004 he played for Fluminense. On October 21, 2004 he was fired from the club after a conflict with the coach. He then went back to play for the team he started in, Vasco da Gama, and has been playing then ever since. He has recently hinted that he might play for the entire season of 2006, and then retire, although his retirement has been announced numerous times before.

On April 28th 2005, Romario played his last game with the Brazilian national team. He scored the second goal on Brazil's 3-0 win against Guatemala.

In 2005 at nearly 40 years of age, Romario scored an outstanding amount of goals (22) in the Brazilian Championship, making him the league's top goalscorer.

Despite rumors stating he would play for Corinthians or Fluminense during the 2006 season, Romario decided to stay for another season at Vasco da Gama.

He is the second best scorer of all times in the Brazilian League being leading scorer 6 times.

Romario was named as one of the top 125 greatest living footballers in March 2004.

Many of Romario's fans, both in Brazil and around the world, feel that he is still, at 40 years of age, good enough to play for Brazil in the World Cup to be held in Germany 2006, but that appears highly unlikely as Rom·rio has retired from the national side. Brazil are unlikely to include him, at age 40, despite Romario being the top scorer in the 2005 Championship.

<p>Ronaldinho</p>
<i>
PROFILE:
Full name : Ronaldo de Assis Moreira
Date of birth : 21 March 1980 
Place of birth : Porto Alegre, Brazil
Height : 1.82 m 
Playing position : Winger / Attacking midfielder

Mini Bio:
Ronaldo de Assis Moreira was born on the 21st of March, 1980 in Porto Alegre, capital of the southernmost Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Sul. He was the youngest of three children born to Joao de Assis Moreira, a shipyard worker and Miguelina, a salesperson who used to sell cosmetics before studying to be a nurse. He shares his birthday with the legendary Ayrton Senna, who dominated F-1 before his untimely death in the early 90's. Joao once played for Cruzeiro, and he encouraged both his sons to take an active interest in the beautiful game.

Joao's second son was given the name of Ronaldinho in order to differentiate between himself and Ronaldo Luis Nazario de Lima, also better known to the world as Ronaldo. Ronaldo himself was known as Ronaldinho when Ronaldo Guiaro was called Ronaldo, and at that time Ronaldinho also had the word Gaucho attached to his name. Ronaldinho is Portuguese for ''little Ronaldo''.

 Roberto Assis, Ronaldinho's elder brother was a pretty good footballer himself. He played for Gremio under Luiz Felipe Scolari before injuries forced him out of the game at an early age. With his father, who had died when Ronaldinho was 8, having been a supporter of Gremio as well, it was but natural that Ronaldinho joined the club. He starred in Brazil's first ever win at the U-17 Championships, held in Egypt in 1997. Ronaldinho made his first senior appearance for Gremio at the Copa Libertadores in 1998.

Ronaldinho's greatest assets have been his ball control, agility and trickery. He can dribble and pass like few people can, and defenders can feel like utter fools when they are up against him. He slowly made a name for himself at Gremio, and was inducted into the Brazilian team in 1999. He made his international debut against Latvia in June 1999, and was part of the Brazilian team which won the Copa America in the same year. He scored one goal in Brazil's 7-0 thrashing of Venezuela in the group stages. He won both the Golden Ball and the Golden Boot at the 1999 Confederations Cup. He scored in every game Brazil played, and missed the final due to injury, where they lost to Mexico.

As the 21st century started, news of Ronaldinho's abilities spread far and wide. Despite interest from England, he decided to move to France to join Paris St.Germain at the end of the 2001 season. He played alongside the likes of Jay Jay Okocha and Nicolas Anelka at PSG under manager Luis Fernandez. The 2002 World Cup firmly established Ronaldinho as a man destined for great things. His goal knocked England out at the quarterfinal stage - a freekick from the right which was completely misjudged by opposition goalkeeper David Seaman. Brazil went on to beat Germany in the final, and clubs started queueing up for the playmaker. With PSG not winning trophies in Europe, he had to make a move to further his career. Although Manchester United and FC Barcelona were both interested in his services, he transferred to the Catalans for a fee of £21 million.

The move to Barcelona was a very significant one in terms of the power shift in the world of football. Barcelona was in a mini crisis period, outshone domestically by bitter rivals Real Madrid. New president Joan Laporta had promised to bring in changes at the club, and the signing of Ronaldinho from PSG on a 5 year contract was one of those. Laporta had initially wanted to bring in David Beckham, who snubbed the Catalans and moved to the Bernabeu. He was another player in the list of famous R's to play for Barcelona - Romario, Ronaldo and Rivaldo had also played before at the Nou Camp. The success of his childhood idols in Spain might have been one reason why he decided to join the club.

Ronaldinho first played in a Barca jersey against AC Milan in America, scoring the second goal for the Catalans. He helped Barcelona to a second place in the league in the 2003-2004 season, despite being injured for most part of the first half. Ronaldinho epitomises the way the beautiful game should be played. Along with Deco, Samuel Etoo, Ludovic Giuly and Lionel Messi, he transformed Barcelona into a supremely gifted attacking side.

There is probably no limit to Ronaldinho's skills. The ability to play comes to him naturally, and the ball looks alive when at his feet- something similar to magic for extremely gifted magicians, you could say. He virtually conjured a goal out of nowhere, toe punting the goal past a stunned Chelsea defence and Petr Cech in the quarterfinals of the Champions League. To toe punt is an extremely difficult thing to do, and requires extreme accuracy. It was therefore no surprise that when Ronaldinho made his move, the rest of the players just stood where they were and watched awestruck.

Barcelona won the La Liga twice in a row, in 2005 and 2006. They also won the Spanish cup in those two years, and also added the Champions League to their trophy cabinet by beating Arsenal in May 2006. Ronaldinho had a part in everything good that happened at the club. Although the 2006 World Cup campaign was a disappointment for him and the national side, there is no doubt that Ronaldinho will want to have another shot in the next edition to be held in South Africa.

Good things, as they say, do not last. Somewhere down the line, the dream marriage between Barcelona and Ronaldinho started developing cracks. Ronaldinho was accused of not being fit, and indeed, when we saw him without his shirt at the end of a La Liga game, he was not certainly the lean athlete he had been earlier. Ronaldinho's desire to enjoy Barcelona's night life was not appreciated by Frank Riijkard, and his form started dipping. Barcelona lost out on the 2006-07 and 2007-08 La Liga titles to bitter rivals Real Madrid. The 2007-08 season saw Ronaldinho troubled by injuries, and for the first time in December 2007, against Espanyol, he did not start despite being fully fit.

From winning the FIFA World Player twice, Ronaldinho had to be content with a fifth placed finish in 2007. He was not called  up for for the 2007 Copa America by new coach Dunga, which Brazil won by beating Argentina.

In April 2008, Ronaldinho tore a muscle in his right leg and missed the rest of Barcelona's season, including their Champions League semifinal against Manchester United. Rumours flew thick and fast about his future, and Manchester City, Inter Milan and A.C.Milan were among the clubs interested. He was eventually sold to AC Milan for 21 million euros, and took the No.80 jersey as Clarence Seedorf already had the No.10 jersey at the San Siro.

He has shown glimpses of his former abilities at Milan, and scored his first goal for the Rossoneri in the city derby against Inter in September 2008.

Apart from his individual abilities, his mere presence on the field instills a new level of confidence in his teammates, and the opposition mentally loses the game even before it has started. It is amazing what one man can do, and words are not enough to describe the man that Ronnie is. He is part of Pele's list of ''125 Greatest living footballers''. In a survey conducted by a Brazilian magazine, he was also inducted into the Gremio all time favourite team.

Place of birth : Rio de Janeiro, Brazil
Height :1.83 m 
Playing position : Striker

Mini Bio:
Ronaldo Luis Nazario de Lima ( born 22 September 1976), commonly known as Ronaldo, is a Brazilian footballer who currently plays for Corinthians. Ronaldo was one of the most prolific scorers in the world in the 1990s and the early 2000s. He won his first Ballon dOr as the European Footballer of the Year in 1997 and again won the award in 2002. Additionally, he is one of only two men to have won the FIFA Player of the Year award three times, along with French footballer Zinedine Zidane. In 2007, he was named as one of the best starting eleven of all-time by France Football and was named to the FIFA 100, a list of the greatest footballers compiled by fellow countryman Pele. In 2010, he was voted Goal.com's Player of the Decade in an online poll, gathering 43.63% of all votes and was also included as Centre Forward in the Team of the Decade. On February 23, 2010, Ronaldo announced that he will retire after the 2011 season, signing a two-year contract extension with the Corinthians at the same time.

Ronaldo has played for Brazil in 97 international matches, amassing 62 goals. He was a part of the Brazilian squad that won the 1994, and 2002 World Cups. During the 2006 World Cup, Ronaldo became the highest goalscorer in the history of the World Cup with his fifteenth goal, surpassing Gerd Muller's previous record of 14.

Ronaldo made his international debut for Brazil in 1994, in a friendly match in Recife against Argentina. He went to the 1994 FIFA World Cup in the USA as a 17-year-old but did not play. He came to be known as Ronaldinho ("little Ronaldo" in Portuguese), because Ronaldo Rodrigues de Jesus, his older team-mate on the tournament, was also called Ronaldo and also nicknamed Ronald„o ("big Ronaldo") to further distinguish them. Another Brazilian player, Ronaldo de Assis Moreira, who is widely known as Ronaldinho, would come to be called Ronaldinho Gaucho when he joined the Brazilian main national team in 1999.

In the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta, Ronaldo played with the name Ronaldinho on his shirt, since centre back Ronaldo Guiaro, two years his senior, was one of his teammates. Brazil went on to win the bronze medal in Atlanta.

Voted the FIFA World Player of the Year in 1996 and 1997, he scored four goals and made three assists during the 1998 FIFA World Cup. The night before the final, he suffered a convulsive fit. At first Ronaldo was removed from the starting lineup 72 minutes before the match, but he requested to play and was later reinstated by coach Mario Zagallo. Ronaldo did not perform well and he was injured in a collision with French goalkeeper Fabien Barthez. Brazil lost the final to hosts France 3-0. Adrian Williams, professor of clinical neurology at Birmingham University, said that Ronaldo should not have played, saying that he would have been feeling the after effects of the seizure and that "there is no way that he would have been able to perform to the best of his ability within 24 hours of his first fit ó if it was his first fit."

During the 2002 FIFA World Cup Ronaldo again led the national team to their record fifth championship and won the Golden Shoe as top scorer with eight goals and was runner-up to the Golden Ball as most valuable player in the tournament. He also scored against every opponent in the tournament except in the quarter-finals against England. In the final match against Germany, Ronaldo scored his 11th and 12th goals to a round of applause and tied Pele's Brazilian record of 12 career World Cup goals.

Djalma Pereira Dias dos Santos known simply as Djalma Santos (also spelled Dejalma Santos, born 27 February 1929 in S„o Paulo, Brazil) is a Brazilian former football player who started for the Brazil national team in four World Cups, winning two, in 1958 and 1962. Santos is one of the greatest defensive backs that have played for Brazil. While primarily known for his defensive skills, he found time to raid down the right flank and was steadfast in support of the attacking game.

He played in the World Cups of 1954, 1958, 1962, and 1966, the last one aged 37. Santos helped create the final goal of the 1962 Final for Brazil. Noting that the Czech goalkeeper Schroiff was somewhat off his line, Santos lofted a long, massive, high arcing ball, into the goalmouth aided by the glare of the afternoon sun. Schroiff mishandled the cross, and Brazilian striker Vava hammered the ball into goal.

He was the first Brazilian to gain 100 international caps. He played in the World Cups of 1954, 1958, 1962, and 1966, the last one aged 37. Santos helped create the final goal of the 1962 Final for Brazil. Noting that the Czech goalkeeper Schroiff was somewhat off his line, Santos lofted a long, massive, high arcing ball, into the goalmouth aided by the glare of the afternoon sun. Schroiff mishandled the cross, and Brazilian striker Vava hammered the ball into goal. 

According to Football Manager 2008, he is the oldest player that has played for the Brazilian national team at the ripe age of 39 years and 103 days on 9. june 1968.

Mini Bio:
Nilton Reis dos Santos (born May 16, 1925) is a Brazilian former football defender. He was born in Rio de Janeiro. He was a left wing-back who could play anywhere on the left wing. He was best known for his attacking ability.

He was called The Encyclopedia because of his knowledge of the sport of football. NÌlton was a key player in defence during the 1954, 1958 and 1962 World Cup finals (he was also in the Brazilian squad for the 1950 finals, but made no appearances) and became famous for scoring a magnificent goal in the 1958 tournament when Brazil played Austria. Dribbling his way through the whole field, he finished with a superb shot, driving his coach Vicente Feola crazy (he kept on insisting for Nilton to retreat to the defensive field, but was ignored until the goal was scored).

Nilton Santos played for only 2 teams in his professional career; Botafogo de Futebol e Regatas and the Brazilian national team collecting 75 caps and scoring 3 goals; he is regarded as one of the best left wingbacks in the history of the game.

Place of birth : Belem do Para, Brazil
Height : 1.93 m 
Playing position :Midfielder, Forward

Mini Bio:
Socrates Brasileiro Sampaio de Souza Vieira de Oliveira, MD, Ph.D (born February 19, 1954 in Belem do Para, Brazil), more commonly known simply as Socrates, is a former Brazilian footballer. He was an excellent assister and team organiser, with great through passes and vision of the field. He was also a two-footed player, a prolific goal scorer, and has been described as the most rugged footballer of the Cold War era. His ability to read the game was highly valued, and his signature move was the blind heel pass.

Socrates hometown is Ribeirao Preto in Sao Paulo state. As one of the best midfielders in football history, Socrates played for, and captained, Brazil in the 1982 World Cup. However, Edinho replaced him as captain for the 1986 FIFA World Cup with Socrates playing as a regular midfielder. He began playing football professionally in 1974 for Botafogo in Ribeirao Preto, but spent the majority of his career (1978 to 1984) with Corinthians in Sao Paulo, where he became famous for using football to challenge the existing military dictatorship. During his time there he co-founded the Corinthians Democracy movement. Socrates and his team mates protested against the regime's treatment of footballers, and showed support to the wider movement for democratisation, by wearing shirts with 'Democracia' written on them during games. Socrates has stated that his childhood heroes were Fidel Castro, Che Guevara and John Lennon.

Socrates was capped sixty times for Brazil between May 1979 and June 1986. He also played for Italian club Fiorentina and the Brazilian clubs Flamengo and Santos towards the end of his career.

In 2004, more than a decade after retiring, Socrates agreed to a one month player-coaching deal with Garforth Town of the Northern Counties East Football League in England. He made his only appearance for the club on November 20, 2004 against Tadcaster Albion, coming on as a substitute twelve minutes from time.

Pele named him as one of the Top 125 Living Footballers in March 2004, and World Soccer named him one of 100 best footballers in history.

In October 2008, Socrates was inducted into the Pacembu Brazilian Football Museum Hall of Fame.

Playing position : Playmaker, attacking midfielder

Mini Bio:
Arthur Antunes Coimbra ( born 3 March 1953 in Rio de Janeiro), better known as Zico , is a Brazilian coach and former footballer. Often called the "White Pele", he is commonly considered one of the most skilled dribblers and finishers ever and possibly the world's best player of the early 80's. He was also known as one of history's greatest free kick specialists, able to bend the ball with pace and accuracy as well as having an extremely powerful shot. The gifted midfielder was named by Pele as one of the top 125 greatest living footballers in March 2004. Also according to Pele, considered by some to be the greatest footballer ever, "throughout the years, the one player that came closest to me was Zico".

Zico scored 52 goals in 72 international matches for Brazil, and represented them in the 1978, 1982 and 1986 World Cups. They did not win any of those tournaments, even though the 1982 squad is considered one of the greatest Brazilian national squads ever . Zico is often considered one of the best players in football history not to have been on a World Cup winning squad. He was chosen 1983 Player of the Year.

Zico has coached the Japanese national team, appearing in the 2006 FIFA World Cup and winning the Asian Cup 2004, and Fenerbahce, who were a quarter-finalist in 2007-08 in the Champions League under his command. He was announced as the head coach of CSKA Moscow in January 2009. On September 16, 2009, Zico was signed by Greek side Olympiacos F.C. for a two-year contract after the club's previous coach, Temuri Ketsbaia, was sacked. He was fired four months later, on January 19, 2010.[6] On May 30th of 2010, Zico announced that he would become the new Soccer Executive/Director for Flamengo, coming back to the team where he won his most important honors after 25 years. One of his demands is that his salary won't be paid by the club. Instead, it will be paid by Flamengo's sponsors such as Olympikus and BMG. His contract is for four years.

After Brazil's first presidential election in many years, the new president Fernando Collor de Mello appointed Zico as his Minister of Sports. Zico stayed at this political assignment for about a year and his most important contribution was a piece of legislation dealing with the business side of sport teams.

Date of birth : 22 February 1969 
Place of birth  : Vienna, Austria
Height: 1.86 m 
Playing position : Attacking midfielder / Striker

Mini Bio:
Brian Laudrup (born 22 February 1969) is a Danish former football player who is a commentator for TV3+ and runs a youth coaching camp.

During his active career, Laudrup represented a number of European clubs. He started his active career with Danish club Br¯ndby, winning two Danish championships in the late 1980s. He then played for German and Italian clubs, winning the 1994 Serie A title with AC Milan. He was a vital part of the Rangers team which dominated the Scottish Premier League in the 1990s, winning three championships among others. He won the 1998 UEFA Super Cup with English club Chelsea, had a brief stint with FC Copenhagen in Denmark, before ending his career with Dutch club Ajax in 2000. He played 82 games and scored 21 goals for the Danish national team, and was a vital part of the Danish teams who won the Euro 1992 and 1995 Intercontinental Cup tournaments.

He won the Danish Footballer of the Year award a record four times.

Laudrup got his international debut for the Denmark national under-17 football team in July 1984, and played six games for the team until October that year. From October 1985 to August 1987, he played 12 games and scored six goals for the Denmark under-19s. He also represented the Danish under-21 national team in five games from June 1987 to November 1988. He was called up for the senior Danish national team by coach Sepp Piontek in April 1987, as a replacement for his brother Michael,but did not get his debut.

He was included in the senior Danish "Olympic national team" of under-21 coach Richard Moller Nielsen, and took part in three qualification games for the 1988 Summer Olympics. He made his debut on 18 November 1987, at the age of 18, in a 0ñ1 defeat to West Germany, with Bjarne GoldbÊk also debuting in that game. Laudrup scored his first national team goal in his third game, a 4-0 win against Greece on April 20, 1988. He was then included as a part of coach Piontek's selection ahead of the Euro 1988. He came on as a substitute in a friendly match against Austria in April 1988, but broke his collarbone just before the final Euro 1988 squad was named.

He was recalled to the senior national team in February 1989, and became a mainstay in the team under new national team coach Richard Moller Nielsen. He scored three goals in four games, as Denmark narrowly missed qualification for the 1990 World Cup. During the dispute with Brondby over his transfer fee, it was discussed whether the Danish Football Association should ban Laudrup from the national team. Following three games in the qualfication campaign for the Euro 1992, Laudrup decided to quit the national team in November 1990 alongside Michael Laudrup and Jan Bartram, as he lacked respect for coach Nielsen.

With four goals in seven games, Laudrup was an important part of the Danish team that qualified for the 1998 World Cup, the only World Cup participation of his career. Alongside Peter Schmeichel and brother Michael Laudrup, Brian shone at the tournament, and he saw Denmark through to the quarter finals with a goal in the 4ñ1 surprise thrashing of Nigeria in the first knock-out round. The quarter-finals would be his last game for the Denmark team, when they were defeated 2ñ3 by the later runners-up Brazil, despite Brian Laudrup scoring on a volley to the top near corner of the goal to level the game at 2ñ2. Until the Brazil match, when Laudrup had scored for Denmark, they had never lost.

The quarter-final was the best ever Danish result at a World Cup, and Laudrup later ranked the 1998 Denmark team higher than the Euro 1992 winning side.[21] He was named as one of the 16 players selected by FIFA as the "All Star Team" of the World Cup, alongside his brother Michael. After the tournament, Laudrup decided to end his national team career at the top, having played in 82 matches, scoring 21 goals over the course of eleven years.

Place of birth : Frederiksberg, Denmark
Height :  1.83 m 
Playing position : Attacking midfielder

Mini Bio:
Michael Laudrup (born 15 June 1964 in Frederiksberg) is a retired Danish footballer. Most recently, he has been linked with the potential coaching vacancy at Spanish side Atletico de Madrid. His most prominent run of football came with Spanish club Barcelona, with whom he won four straight La Liga championships. He famously moved to arch rivals Real Madrid in 1994, with whom he won his fifth La Liga title in a row. He scored 37 goals in a total of 104 appearances for the Denmark national football team, which is only topped by Peter Schmeichel's 129 games, Jon Dahl Tomasson's 110 games and Thomas Helveg's 108 games. From November 1994, he captained his country for a total of 28 matches before his retirement in June 1998.

In 1999, he was voted the Best Foreign Player in Spanish Football over the previous 25-year period and in April 2000 he was knighted, receiving the Order of the Dannebrog. In November 2003, to celebrate UEFA's Jubilee, he was selected as the Golden Player of Denmark by the Danish Football Association; their most outstanding player of the past 50 years. He was officially named the best Danish footballer of all time by the Danish Football Association (DBU) in November 2006.

After ending his playing career, Laudrup took up coaching, and became assistant manager of the Danish national team. He got his first manager job at former club Brondby in 2002, whom he guided to the 2005 Danish Superliga championship. He chose not to extend his contract with Brondby in May 2006. In 2007, Brondby decided to name a new lounge at the stadium "The Michael Laudrup Lounge", with Laudrup's approval. He subsequently took over as coach of Getafe, Madrid's third club, and continued his coaching career with notable success there. He brought the club comparative success in the Copa del Rey and UEFA Cup, and the team's attacking style brought plaudits.

Laudrup was called up for the Danish national team during Brondby's debut season in the top-flight. On his 18th birthday 15 June 1982 he became the then second youngest Danish national team player ever, following Harald Nielsen. Despite playing for relegation battlers Lazio, Laudrup starred for the Danish national team at the Euro 1984, playing all four Denmark matches.

He took part in the 1986 World Cup in Mexico, a performance which is best remembered for his exceptional solo dribble and goal in the 6ñ1 defeat of Uruguay. He was also a part of the disappointing Danish national team at the Euro 1988 tournament, though Laudrup experienced personal success as he scored one of Denmark's two goals. Following three games in the qualfication campaign for Euro 1992, Laudrup decided to quit the national team in November 1990 alongside Brian Laudrup and Jan Bartram, following differences with coach Richard Moller Nielsen. Denmark eventually won the tournament.

He returned to coach Nielsen's Danish squad in August 1993, but saw Spain qualify for the 1994 World Cup ahead of Denmark. He scored a goal in the 2-0 victory against Argentina, as Denmark won the 1995 Intercontinental Cup. He also scored four goals in 10 games as Denmark qualified for the Euro 1996, though the tournament would leave no positives for him.

His last games for Denmark came at the 1998 World Cup, when he captained Denmark to the quarter-final. He crowned his tournament performance with a trademark assist in the knock-out stage. In the Round of 16 elimination game against Nigeria, looking to his left, Laudrup launched a lob to his right, over the defenders. The pass was picked up by Ebbe Sand, who headed it past defender Taribo West, and converted the chance for the 3ñ0 goal in the 4ñ1 win against Nigeria. Denmark was defeated 2-3 by Brazil in the quarter-finals, and both Michael and Brian Laudrup announced their international retirement following the World Cup elimination.

Mini Bio:
Peter Boleslaw Schmeichel MBE (born 18 November 1963) is a retired Danish professional footballer who played as a goalkeeper, and was voted the "World's Best Goalkeeper" in 1992 and 1993. He is best remembered for his most successful years at English club Manchester United, whom he captained to the 1999 UEFA Champions League to complete The Treble. He was a key member of the Denmark national football team that won Euro 92.

Born in Gladsaxe, Copenhagen, Schmeichel is famous for his intimidating physique (he is 1.93 m (6 ft 4 in) tall and wears specially-made size XXXL football shirts) and his attacking threat. During his career, Schmeichel scored 11 goals, including one for the Danish national team, a great feat for a keeper. He is also the most capped player for the Denmark national team, with 129 games between 1987 and 2001. Apart from Euro 92, he played for his country at the 1998 FIFA World Cup and three additional European Championship tournaments. He captained the national team in 30 matches. He was one of only 13 players not from the British Isles to play on the opening weekend of the FA Premier League along with Jan Stejskal, Andrei Kanchelskis, Robert Warzycha, Roland Nilsson, Eric Cantona, Hans Segers, John Faxe Jensen, Anders Limpar, Gunnar Halle, Craig Forrest, Michel Vonk and Ronnie Rosenthal.

Schmeichel is also known for his trademark shouts at his defence. He would often yell out at the defenders in charge of helping him defend the goal for blunders and poor defending and would occasionally single out various individuals in the defence to make his feelings heard.

Today, he is widely regarded as one of the greatest goalkeepers in the history of football. The IFFHS ranked Schmeichel among the top ten keepers of the 20th century in 2000, and in 2001, Schmeichel won a public poll held by Reuters, when the majority of the 200,000 participants voted him as the best goalkeeper ever, ahead of Lev Yashin and Gordon Banks. In 2003, Schmeichel was inducted into the English Football Hall of Fame in recognition of his impact on the English game. In March 2004, he was named as one of the "125 greatest living footballers", at the FIFA 100 celebrations.

He holds the record for the greatest clean sheets-to-games ratio in the Premier League with 42% of the games he played in the league ending without his team conceding.

PROFILE:
Full name : Gordon Banks
Date of birth : 30 December 1937 
Place of birth : Sheffield, England
Height :6 ft 1 in 
Playing position: Goalkeeper

Mini Bio:
Gordon Banks, OBE (born 30 December 1937) is a retired English footballer, elected in a poll by the IFFHS as the second best goalkeeper of the 20th Century ó after Lev Yashin  and before Dino Zoff .

Banks was a member of the England national team that won the 1966 World Cup.His consistent performances in goal led to the re-wording of a common English idiom to "Safe as the Banks of England."

By 1965, Banks was indisputably the first-choice England goalkeeper. He was settling into the form of his life which would last for the next seven years; agile and alert, he was frequently seen making amazing reflex saves and possessed flawless positional sense and reading of attackers' movements and instincts.

When the World Cup began, Banks was in goal as England got through their group containing Uruguay, Mexico and France, drawing 0ñ0 with the former and clinching 2ñ0 victories over the latter. Banks was not greatly tested, but it was hugely encouraging that he emerged from the group with three clean sheets from three games, a trend that continued when England beat a physical Argentina side 1ñ0 in the last eight, with Geoff Hurst scoring with a header.

Bobby Charlton scored twice in the semi final against Portugal before a late penalty was conceded by Jack Charlton handling the ball. Banks was finally beaten after 43 minutes when Eusebio put away the spot kick to his right. That said, England had won 2ñ1 and were in the final, where West Germany awaited.

It was England who dominated the final but it was Banks who was beaten first. A weak header from Ray Wilson handed a chance to Helmut Haller whose shot was not fierce but was on target and needed dealing with. Banks thought Jack Charlton was going to clear; Charlton in turn thought Banks had it covered. Neither went for it as a result, and the ball crept in the corner. England equalised through a Geoff Hurst header within six minutes and went ahead late in the second half through Martin Peters.

Banks had little to do during the second half but his known powers of concentration were required when Jack Charlton gave away a dubious free kick 30 yards from goal. Banks duly organised a defensive wall and got into position. Lothar Emmerich slammed the ball into the wall, the ball ricocheted across goal and Banks struggled to follow it across his six yard box, such was the speed and unpredictability of its movement as it took deflections and swipes. Ultimately German defender Wolfgang Weber reached it at the far post and swept it into the net with Banks diving in vain to get his palms to the ball. The final whistle went seconds later to send the game into extra time.

England took the lead in extra time with that hotly debated second goal from Hurst. Banks not troubled again until the final minute, when he saved a shot from Siggy Held and moments later could only watch as Uwe Seeler lunged for the ball and missed. Hurst then scored his hat-trick goal and the game was over. Gordon Banks had 33 England caps and was a world champion. But his career at club level was shortly to take an interesting and unexpected turn.

Coming through the ranks at Leicester City was a young local goalkeeper called Peter Shilton, who was given his debut as a 17-year-old in 1966. It was clear that Shilton was something special, yet the man he had to displace was now regarded as the world's number one goalkeeper. When Shilton told Leicester he would not sign a professional contract unless he was guaranteed first team football, Banks found himself available for transfer, just a year after winning the World Cup.

Banks joined Stoke City and maintained his England place, while Shilton lost in Leicester's third FA Cup final of the 1960s (the 1969 game against Manchester City) and began to make his name. Ramsey gave the odd chance to Chelsea keeper Peter Bonetti, Everton's Gordon West and Manchester United's Alex Stepney, but when the big games came along, it was only Banks. During this time, Gordon Banks moved to Madeley, Staffordshire. In one of the more bizarre episodes in football history, in 1967, Banks played a season for the Cleveland Stokers of the American United Soccer Association (USA). The USA was a short lived attempt to build a first division U.S. league by importing clubs from around the world to play as U.S. teams. Stoke City, with Banks, came to the U.S. where it played in Cleveland, Ohio. England reached the last four of the 1968 European Championships where they lost to Yugoslavia in Florence. A year later, Banks picked up his 50th cap as England defeated Scotland 4ñ1 at Wembley. He played in nine more internationals prior to the start of the 1970 World Cup in Mexico, for which England once again had not needed to qualify, this time owing to their status as holders.

Banks, who discovered just after arriving in Mexico that he had been awarded the OBE, played his 60th England game in the opening group victory over Romania before taking to the field for the keenly-awaited clash with Brazil. After just ten minutes, Banks wrote himself into football folklore.

On Tuesday 9 May 2006, Gordon Banks was the first "legend" to be inducted into a new Walk of Fame, by having a plaque installed in the pavement in front of the Town Hall. Banks made a speech to an attendant crowd as to how thrilled he was to be given this honour. The plaque is made of bronze, and is a star set in a circle with a blue background, and the words "SHEFFIELD LEGEND" GORDON BANKS OBE. FOOTBALLER.

Place of birth : Leytonstone, London, England
Height : 6 ft 0 in
Playing position : Midfielder

Mini Bio:
David Robert Joseph Beckham, OBE (born 2 May 1975) is an English footballer who currently plays in midfield for Milan in Serie A, on loan from Major League Soccer club Los Angeles Galaxy. He is also an established member of the England national team.

Twice runner-up for FIFA World Player of the Year and in 2004 the world's highest-paid footballer when taking into account salary and advertising deals.Beckham was the first British footballer to play 100 Champions League matches. He was Google's most searched of all sports topics in both 2003 and 2004. With such global recognition he has become an elite advertising brand and a top fashion icon. Beckham was captain of England from 15 November 2000 until the 2006 FIFA World Cup finals, during which he played 58 times. Since then he has continued to represent his country and earned his much-publicised hundredth cap for England against France on 26 March 2008.He is currently England's most-capped outfield player with 115 appearances.

Beckham's career began when he signed a professional contract with Manchester United, making his first-team debut in 1992 aged 17.During his time there, United won the Premier League title six times, the FA Cup twice, and the UEFA Champions League in 1999. He left Manchester United to sign for Real Madrid in 2003, where he remained for four seasons,clinching the La Liga championship in his final season with the club.

In January 2007, it was announced that Beckham would leave Real Madrid and sign a five-year contract with Major League Soccer club Los Angeles Galaxy. Beckham's contract with Los Angeles Galaxy became effective on 1 July 2007 and gave him the highest player salary in MLS history. His playing contract with Galaxy in 2007, 2008 and 2009 was worth $6.5m per year. He debuted for the team on 21 July 2007 in a friendly versus Chelsea at The Home Depot Center, and on 15 August, he had his first start with the team, scoring his first goal in the 2007 SuperLiga semi-final. His first league start then came on 18 August in front of a record crowd at Giants Stadium.

Beckham made his first appearance for the England national football team on 1 September 1996, in a World Cup qualifying match against Moldova.

Beckham had played in all of England's qualifying matches for the 1998 World Cup and was part of the England squad at the World Cup finals in France,but the team's manager Glenn Hoddle publicly accused him of not concentrating on the tournament,and he did not start in either of England's first two matches. He was picked for their third match against Colombia and scored from a long-range free kick in a 2ñ0 victory, which was his first goal for England.

In the second round (last 16) of that competition, he received a red card in England's match against Argentina. Beckham, after having been fouled by Diego Simeone, kicked Simeone whilst lying on the floor, striking him on the calf muscle. Simeone later admitted to trying to get Beckham sent off by over-reacting to the kick and then, along with other members of his team, urging the referee to send Beckham off.The match finished in a draw and England were eliminated in a penalty shootout. Many supporters and journalists blamed him for England's elimination and he became the target of criticism and abuse, including the hanging of an effigy outside a London pub, and the Daily Mirror printing a dartboard with a picture of him centred on the bullseye. Beckham also received death threats after the World Cup.

The abuse that Beckham was receiving from English supporters peaked during England's 3ñ2 defeat by Portugal in Euro 2000, a match where Beckham set up two goals, when a group of England supporters taunted him throughout the match. Beckham responded by raising his middle finger and, while the gesture attracted some criticism, many of the newspapers that had previously encouraged his vilification asked their readers to stop abusing him.

On 15 November 2000, following Kevin Keegan's resignation as England manager in October, Beckham was promoted to team captain by the caretaker manager Peter Taylor, and then kept the role under new manager Sven-Gˆran Eriksson. He helped England to qualify for the 2002 World Cup Finals, with their performances including an impressive 5ñ1 victory over Germany in Munich. The final step in Beckham's conversion from villain to hero happened in England's 2ñ2 draw against Greece on 6 October 2001. England needed to win or draw the match in order to qualify outright for the World Cup, but were losing 2ñ1 with little time remaining. When Teddy Sheringham was fouled eight yards (7 metres) outside the Greek penalty area, England were awarded a free-kick and Beckham ensured England's qualification with a curling strike of the kind that had become his trademark. Shortly afterwards, he was voted the BBC Sports Personality of the Year for 2001. He once again finished runner-up, to LuÌs Figo of Portugal, for the FIFA World Player of the Year award.

Beckham was partially fit by the time of the 2002 World Cup and played in the first match against Sweden. Beckham scored the winning goal of the match against Argentina with a penalty, causing Argentina to fail to qualify for the knockout stage. England were knocked out of the tournament in the quarter-finals by eventual winners Brazil. The following month, at the opening ceremony of the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester, Beckham escorted Kirsty Howard as she presented the Jubilee Baton to the Queen.

Beckham played in all of England's matches at Euro 2004, but the tournament was a disappointment for him. He had a penalty saved in England's 2ñ1 defeat to France and missed another in a penalty shootout in the quarter-final against Portugal. England lost the shootout and went out of the competition.

Beckham became a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador in January 2005 and was involved in promoting London's successful bid for the 2012 Olympic Games. In October 2005, Beckham's sending off against Austria made him the first ever England captain to be sent off and the first (and only) player to be sent off twice while playing for England. He captained England for the 50th time in a friendly international against Argentina the following month.

In England's opening game at the 2006 World Cup, against Paraguay on 10 June 2006, Beckham's free kick led to an own-goal by Carlos Gamarra as England won 1ñ0. In England's next match, played against Trinidad and Tobago on 15 June 2006, Beckham's cross in the 83rd minute led to a Peter Crouch goal, which put England into the lead 1ñ0. Beckham gave another assist to Steven Gerrard. In the end they won 2ñ0. He was named Man of the Match by tournament sponsor Budweiser for this game.

During England's second round match against Ecuador, Beckham scored from a free kick in the 59th minute, becoming the first ever English player to score in three separate World Cups, and giving England a 1ñ0 victory and a place in the quarter-finals. He was sick before the game and vomited several times as a result of dehydration and illness after he scored the winning goal.

In the quarter-final against Portugal, Beckham was substituted following an injury shortly after half time and the England team went on to lose the match on penalties (3ñ1), the score having been 0ñ0 after extra time. After his substitution, Beckham was visibly shaken and emotional for not being able to play, being in tears at one point.

A day after England were knocked out of the World Cup, an emotional Beckham made a statement in a news conference saying that he had stepped down as England captain,saying, "It has been an honour and privilege to captain my country but, having been captain for 58 of my 95 games, I feel the time is right to pass on the armband as we enter a new era under Steve McClaren." (Beckham had actually won 94 caps up to that point.) He was succeeded by Chelsea captain John Terry.

Having stepped down as captain after the World Cup, Beckham was dropped completely from the England national team selected by new coach Steve McClaren on 11 August 2006. McClaren claimed that he was "looking to go in a different direction" with the team, and that Beckham "wasn't included within that." McClaren said Beckham could be recalled in future. Shaun Wright-Phillips, Kieran Richardson, and the World Cup alternative to Beckham, Aaron Lennon, were all included, although McClaren eventually opted to employ Steven Gerrard in that role.

On 26 May 2007, McClaren announced that Beckham would be recalled to the England squad for the first time since stepping down as their captain. Beckham started against Brazil in England's first match at the new Wembley Stadium and put in a positive performance. In the second half, he set up England's goal converted by captain John Terry. It looked as though England would claim victory over Brazil, but newcomer Diego equalised in the dying seconds. In England's next match, a Euro 2008 qualifier against Estonia, Beckham sent two trademark assists for Michael Owen and Peter Crouch, helping England to prevail 3ñ0.

Beckham had assisted in three of England's four total goals in those two games,and he stated his desire to continue to play for England after his move to Major League Soccer.

On 22 August 2007, Beckham played in a friendly for England against Germany, becoming the first ever to play for England while with a non-European club team. On 21 November 2007, Beckham earned his 99th cap against Croatia, setting up a goal for Peter Crouch to tie the game at 2ñ2. Following the 2ñ3 loss, England failed to qualify for the Euro 2008 Finals. Despite this, Beckham said that he has no plans to retire from international football and wanted to continue playing for the national team. After being passed over by new England coach and Beckham's former manager at Real Madrid, Fabio Capello, for a friendly against Switzerland which would have given him his hundredth cap; Beckham admitted that he was not in shape at the time, as he had not played a competitive match in three months.

On 20 March 2008, Beckham was recalled to the England squad by Capello for the friendly against France in Paris on 26 March. Beckham became only the fifth Englishman to win 100 caps. Capello had hinted on 25 March 2008 that Beckham had a long term future in his side ahead of crucial qualifiers for the 2010 World Cup.On 11 May 2008, Capello included an in-form Beckham in his 31 man England squad to face the United States at Wembley Stadium on 28 May before the away fixture with Trinidad and Tobago on 1 June. Beckham was honoured before the match by receiving an honorary gold cap representing his 100th cap from Bobby Charlton, and was given a standing ovation from the crowd. He played well and assisted John Terry on the match-winning goal. When substituted at half-time for David Bentley, the pro-Beckham crowd booed the decision. In a surprise move, Capello handed Beckham the captaincy for England's friendly against Trinidad and Tobago on 1 June 2008. The match was the first time since the 2006 World Cup that Beckham had skippered England and marked a dramatic turnaround for Beckham. In two years, he had gone from being dropped completely from the England squad to being reinstated (though temporarily) as England captain.

During the 2010 World Cup Qualifier against Belarus in which England won 3ñ1 in Minsk, Beckham came off the bench in the 87th minute to earn his 107th cap making him England's 3rd highest capped player in history, over-taking Bobby Charlton in the process. On 11 February 2009, Beckham drew level with Bobby Moore's record of 108 caps for an English outfield player, coming on as a substitute for Stewart Downing in a friendly match against Spain.On 28 March 2009, Beckham surpassed Moore to hold the record outright when he came on as a substitute in a friendly against Slovakia, providing the assist for a goal from Wayne Rooney in the process.

PROFILE:
Full name : Sir Robert Charlton CBE
Date of birth : 11 October 1937 
Place of birth : Ashington, England
Height : 5 ft 8 in 
Playing position :Midfielder Forward

Mini Bio:
Sir Robert "Bobby" Charlton CBE (born 11 October 1937 in Ashington, Northumberland) is an English former professional football player who won the World Cup and was named the European Footballer of the Year in 1966. He played almost all of his club football at Manchester United, where he became renowned for his attacking instincts from midfield and his ferocious long-range shot. His elder brother Jack, who was also in the World Cup-winning team, was a former defender for Leeds United and coach.

He began to play for United's first team in 1956, and over the next two seasons gained a regular place in the team, during which time he survived the Munich air disaster of 1958. After helping United to win the Football League in 1965, he won a World Cup medal with England in 1966 and another Football League title with United the following year. In 1968, he captained the Manchester United team that won the European Cup, scoring two goals in the final to help his team be the first English side to win the competition. He has scored more goals for England and United than any other player. He had made more appearances for Manchester United than any other player (758),a record superseded by Ryan Giggs at the Champions League Final in Moscow on 21 May 2008. However, Charlton still owns the club record for most league appearances with 606, and is considered by many to be one of the greatest English players of all time.

At the time of his retirement from the England team in 1970, he was the nation's most capped player, having turned out 106 times at the highest level. This record has since been eclipsed by Bobby Moore, Peter Shilton and then David Beckham.

He left Manchester United in 1973, becoming player-manager of Preston North End, but decided management was not for him and left after one season. After assuming the post of the director at Wigan Athletic for some time, he became a member of Manchester United's board of directors in 1984 and remains one as of May 2010. He set goalscoring records for both the England team and Manchester United, with both records remaining intact some 35 years after the end of his playing career. He was knighted in 1994.

In 1966 WC ,England drew the opening game of the tournament 0ñ0 with Uruguay, and Charlton scored the first goal in the 2ñ0 win over Mexico. This was followed by an identical scoreline against France, allowing England to qualify for the quarter finals.

England defeated Argentina 1ñ0 ñ the game was the only one in which Charlton received a caution ñ and faced Portugal in the semi finals. This turned out to be one of Charlton's most important games for England.

Charlton opened the scoring with a crisp side-footed finish after a run by Roger Hunt had forced the Portuguese goalkeeper out of his net; his second was a sweetly struck shot after a run and pull-back from Geoff Hurst. Charlton and Hunt were now England's joint-highest scorers in the tournament with three each, and a final against West Germany beckoned.

The final turned out to be one of Charlton's quieter days; he and a young Franz Beckenbauer effectively marked each other out of the game. England won 4ñ2 after extra time.

England began the tournament with two victories in the group stages, plus a memorable defeat against Brazil. Charlton played in all three, though was substituted for Alan Ball in the final game of the group against Czechoslovakia. Ramsey, confident of victory and progress to the quarter final, wanted Charlton to rest.

England duly reached the last eight where they again faced West Germany. Charlton controlled the midfield and suppressed Franz Beckenbauer's runs from deep as England coasted to a 2ñ0 lead. Beckenbauer pulled a goal back for the Germans and Ramsey replaced the ageing and tired Charlton with Colin Bell who further tested the German keeper Maier and also provided a great cross for Geoff Hurst who uncharacteristically squandered the chance. West Germany, who had a habit of coming back from behind, eventually scored twice ñ a back header from Uwe Seeler made it 2ñ2 after which Gerd M¸ller's goal finished England off. England were out and, after a record 106 caps and 49 goals, Charlton decided to end his international career at the age of 32. On the flight home from Mexico, he asked Ramsey not to consider him again. His brother Jack, two years his senior but 71 caps his junior, did likewise.

Despite populist opinion the substitution did not change the game as Franz Beckenbauer had scored before Charlton left the field, hence Charlton had failed to cancel out the German. Charlton himself conceded that the substitution did not affect the game in a BBC documentary. His caps record lasted until 1973 when Bobby Moore overtook him, and Charlton currently lies fourth in the all-time England appearances list behind Moore, David Beckham and Peter Shilton, whose own England career began in the first game after Charlton's had ended. As of December 2009, Charlton's goalscoring record still stands.

During the early 1970s, Manchester United were no longer competing among the top teams in England, and at several stages were battling against relegation. At times, Charlton was not on speaking terms with United's other superstars George Best and Denis Law, and Best refused to play in Charlton's testimonial match against Celtic, saying that "to do so would be hypocritical". Charlton left Manchester United at the end of the 1972ñ73 season, having scored 249 goals and set a club record of 758 appearances, a record which Ryan Giggs broke in the 2008 UEFA Champions League Final. His goalscoring record, however, is still intact by a comfortable margin.

<p>Kevin Keegan</p>

PROFILE:
Full name : Joseph Kevin Keegan
Date of birth : 14 February 1951 
Place of birth : Armthorpe, Doncaster, England
Height : 5 ft 8 in 
Playing position : Strike

Mini Bio:
Joseph Kevin Keegan, OBE (born 14 February 1951)is a former international footballer, and former manager of several English clubs, most notably Newcastle United, as well as the England national football team.

He began his playing career at Scunthorpe United in 1968, before moving to Liverpool of Division One in 1971. At Liverpool, Keegan won three First Division titles, two UEFA Cups, one FA Cup and the European Cup. He also gained his first England cap in 1972, and moved to German top-flight club Hamburger SV in the summer of 1977. At Hamburg he was crowned European Footballer of the Year in both 1978 and 1979, won the Bundesliga title in 1978ñ79, and reached the European Cup final the following year. Keegan moved to Southampton that summer, and spent two seasons at the club before a transfer to second-tier Newcastle United in 1982. He helped Newcastle to promotion in his second season, and retired from football in 1984, having been capped 63 times for England, scoring 21 goals.

He moved into management at Newcastle in 1992, again returning the club to the top-flight, as Second Division champions. After promotion, Keegan's Newcastle finished second in the Premier League in 1995ñ96, after leading the table most of the season. After a spell at Fulham, he took charge of the England team in 1999 but resigned in the autumn of 2000, following a loss against Germany in World Cup qualification (this was also the last game at the old Wembley Stadium). He then became manager of Manchester City in 2001 and spent four years at the club before resigning in 2005. He had been out of football for almost three years when he returned to Newcastle United for a second spell as manager in January 2008. This spell lasted only eight months, however, as Keegan resigned on 4 September 2008 following days of speculation regarding a dispute with the club directors.

Keegan made his England debut on 15 November 1972 in a 1ñ0 World Cup qualifying win over Wales. Keegan only appeared in the two matches against Wales during this campaign as England failed to qualify for the 1974 FIFA World Cup.

He scored his first international goal in his third appearance, also against Wales, on 11 May 1974. He scored 21 goals in total for his country in 63 games. He was given the captaincy by manager Don Revie in 1976 after Gerry Francis fell from favour. He retained the captain's armband until his international retirement after the 1982 World Cup.

He only managed one World Cup appearance though, after England failed to qualify for both the 1974 and 1978 tournaments. His World Cup experience was limited to just 26 minutes after injury wrecked his chance in England's 1982 campaign. He recovered sufficiently to appear as a substitute in their final game against hosts Spain, during which he famously missed a headed chance to break the deadlock.

Following the successful start to the 1982-83 season with Newcastle United, there was much controversy when newly appointed England manager Bobby Robson did not select him for the national side

<p>Gary Lineker</p>
<i>
PROFILE:
Full name : Gary Winston Lineker
Date of birth : 30 November 1960 
Place of birth : Leicester, England
Height : 1.80 m 
Playing position : Striker

Mini Bio:
Gary Winston Lineker,  (born 30 November 1960) is a retired English footballer, who played as a striker. He is a sports broadcaster for the BBC and Eredivisie Live. He remains England's top scorer in the FIFA World Cup finals, with 10 goals.

Lineker began his football career at Leicester City and became known as a prolific goalscorer; despite failing to score in his first ten games, he finished as the First Division's joint top goalscorer in 1984ñ85 and earning his first England cap. He moved to Everton where he remained a clinical finisher, scoring 38 goals in 52 games. His first team honours came at Barcelona, where he won the Copa del Rey in 1988 and the European Cup Winners' Cup in 1989. He returned to England in 1989, joining Tottenham Hotspur, and over three seasons he scored 67 goals in 105 games and won the FA Cup. Lineker's final club was Nagoya Grampus Eight and he retired in 1994 after two seasons at the Japanese side.

Lineker made his England debut in 1984 and over the following eight years earned 80 caps and scored 48 goals, finishing as England's all-time second highest scorer. His international goals-to-games ratio remains one of the best for the country and he is regarded as one of the all-time best English strikers. He was top scorer in the 1986 World Cup and received the Golden Shoe, the only time an Englishman has achieved this feat. He is also the only player to have won the English golden boot with 3 different clubs (Leicester City, Everton and Tottenham Hotspur). Lineker is noted for never having been cautioned or sent off by a referee during his professional career.

After his retirement from football he was inducted into the English Football Hall of Fame. He moved in to broadcasting, working at the BBC, firstly working as a pundit on Match of the Day before he went on to present the flagship show. Lineker also worked on other programmes at the BBC. He led a consortium that invested in his old club Leicester, saving it from bankruptcy, and was appointed honorary vice-president. Since 1994, Lineker has featured in several television commercials for Walkers Crisps. He has four sons with his ex-wife Michelle and is now married to model Danielle Lineker.

In 2009, Leicester City fans voted him as the club's greatest ever player in a poll by Sky Sports. He received 37% of votes; more than double that of his closest competitor, legendary goalkeeper Gordon Banks.

He first played for the England national team against Scotland in 1984. He played five games in the 1986 World Cup, and was top scorer of the tournament with six goals, winning the Golden Boot, making him the first and to this day only English player to have done so. He played most of the tournament wearing a lightweight cast on his forearm. He did score for England in the World Cup quarter-final against Argentina, but the game ended in defeat as Diego Maradona scored twice for the opposition (the first goal being the infamous "Hand of God" handball) and England were out of the competition. Lineker also scored a brace against Paraguay in the second round of the tournament. Lineker combined with Peter Beardsley, who also scoredóto effortlessly dismantle the South American team's defence.

In 1988, Lineker played in the Euro 1988, but failed to score as England lost all three Group games. It was later established that he had been suffering from hepatitis.

In the 1990 World Cup, he scored four goals to help England reach the semi-finals after a string of draws and narrow victories. After Andreas Brehme sent England 1ñ0 down, he scored an equaliser after receiving a pass from Paul Parker and faking two German defenders, but the West Germans triumphed in the penalty shoot-out and went on to win the trophy.

He retired from international football with 80 caps and 48 goals, one fewer goal than Bobby Charlton's England record (although Charlton took 26 more caps to score his one extra goal). In what proved to be his last England match, against Sweden at Euro 1992, he was controversially substituted by England coach Graham Taylor, in favour of Arsenal striker Alan Smith, ultimately denying Lineker the chance to equalóor even betteróCharlton's record of 49 goals. He had earlier missed a penalty that would have brought him level, in a pre-tournament friendly against Brazil. He was visibly upset at the decision, not looking at Taylor as he took the bench.

He scored four goals in an England match on two occasions and is one of very few players never to have been given a yellow card or a red card in any type of game.

<p>Michael Owen</p>

PROFILE:
Full name : Michael James Owen
Date of birth :14 December 1979 
Place of birth : Chester, England
Height : 5 ft 9 in
Playing position : Striker

Mini Bio:
Michael James Owen (born 14 December 1979 in Chester) is an English professional footballer who plays as a striker for Manchester United.

The son of former footballer Terry Owen, Owen began his senior career at Liverpool in 1996. He progressed through the Liverpool youth team and scored on his debut in May 1997. In his first full season in the Premier League he finished as joint top scorer. He repeated the feat the following year and was Liverpool's top goal scorer from 1997ñ2004, in spite of a recurring hamstring injury. His first major club honours came in 2001 when Liverpool won a cup treble of the UEFA Cup, FA Cup and Football League Cup, and Owen was the recipient of the Ballon dOr that year. He went on to score 118 goals in 216 appearances in the English Premier League for Liverpool.

Owen moved to Real Madrid for £8 million in mid-2004 but was frequently used as a substitute. In spite of this, he scored 13 goals in La Liga and had the season's highest ratio of goals scored to number of minutes played. He returned to England the following season, joining Newcastle United for £16 million. He had a promising start to the 2005ñ06 season but injuries largely ruled him out over the next 18 months. After his return he became team captain and was the team's top scorer for the 2007ñ08 season. After the final season of his four year contract, Newcastle were relegated, and Owen moved to Manchester United as a free agent.

Internationally, Owen first played for the senior England team in 1998, becoming England's youngest player and youngest goalscorer at the time. His performance at the 1998 World Cup brought him to national and international prominence and he went on to appear, and score, in Euro 2000, the 2002 World Cup and Euro 2004. He is the only player to ever have scored in four major tournaments for England. He played at the 2006 World Cup but suffered an injury which took him a year to recover from. Occasionally playing as captain, he is England's seventh most-capped player and has scored a national record of 26 competitive goals, with 40 in total from 89 appearances.

Owen's long injury absence after the 2006 World Cup resulted in a dispute between FIFA and The FA and Newcastle United, and eventually resulted in an unprecedented £10m compensation award to Newcastle, and brought changes to the compensation arrangements between club and country regarding injuries sustained by contracted club players while on international duty.

Owen had a highly successful record at Youth level, playing for the England under-20 team at the 1997 FIFA World Youth Championship and scoring three goals in four games. He was only briefly a member of the England under-21 team (netting on his only appearance in a win over Greece under-21 at Carrow Road) before he made his debut for the senior team in a 2ñ0 friendly loss to Chile on 11 February 1998. Playing in this game made Owen the youngest player to represent England in the 20th century at 18 years and 59 days of age.

Owen's youthful enthusiasm, pace and talent made him a popular player across the country,and many fans were keen for him to be made a regular player for the team ahead of that year's World Cup. His first goal for England, against Morocco in another friendly game prior to the tournament, further enhanced his reputation. The goal also made him the youngest ever player to have scored for England, until his record was surpassed by Wayne Rooney in 2003.

Although he was selected for the World Cup squad by manager Glenn Hoddle, he was left on the bench as a substitute in the first two games. However, his substitute appearance in the second game, a 2ñ1 defeat to Romania, saw him score a goal and hit the post with another shot, almost salvaging a point from the game. After that, Hoddle played him from the start, and in England's second round match against Argentina he scored a sensational individual goal after beating defenders Roberto Ayala and JosÈ Chamot before striking the ball just outside the penalty box.

England drew that match and went out of the tournament on penalties, but Owen had sealed his place as an England choice and his popularity in the country had increased greatly. At the end of the year, he won a public vote to be elected winner of the prestigious BBC Sports Personality of the Year title.

He has since played for England in Euro 2000, the 2002 World Cup and Euro 2004, scoring goals in all three tournaments. This makes him the only player to ever have scored in four major tournaments for England.He also became one of only a handful of England players to appear in three World Cup tournaments when he played at the 2006 FIFA World Cup, although he did not score and was injured in the final group game.

In April 2002, he was named as England's captain for a friendly match against Paraguay in place of the injured regular captain David Beckham. Owen was the youngest England skipper since Bobby Moore in 1963,and in the following few seasons regularly captained England during any absence of the regular captain. Owen made his debut for the England national B-team in a friendly against Belarus on 25 May 2006, as part of his return to match fitness ahead of the 2006 FIFA World Cup. He captained England B in this game, playing for 61 minutes before being substituted.

Owen started England's first two games of the 2006 World Cup, against Paraguay and Trinidad and Tobago, but did not manage to score. After playing only 51 seconds of his third appearance of the tournament, and 80th cap, in the 2006 World Cup against Sweden, Owen badly twisted his left knee and was forced to leave the match on a stretcher.A scan of the injury on 21 June confirmed that Owen had torn the anterior cruciate ligament in his knee, and was sent home, no longer able to play in the tournament.

Owen underwent successful reconstruction surgery, carried out by Dr. Richard Steadman, on 6 September 2006.The injury sidelined him until April 2007, meaning he missed England's first six matches in qualifying for Euro 2008. He returned for the England B game against Albania, and was named in the full squad for the games against Brazil and Estonia, with Owen stating "I feel sharp and, if given the chance, I feel confident when in front of goal." He played in both matches and scored against Estonia, breaking Gary Lineker's record for most goals in competitive internationals for England. Owen's latest international efforts include a brace for England in a 3ñ0 win over Russia on 12 September 2007.

With his two goals against Russia, he became the first player to score international goals at both the old and new Wembley Stadiums. As of 26 August 2008, Owen has been capped 89 times for England and scored 40 goals: he is fourth in the list of all-time top scorers for the England team, behind Bobby Charlton (49 goals), Gary Lineker (48) and Jimmy Greaves (44). He has also scored a record 26 goals for England in competitive matches (World Cup and European Championship games and the qualifiers for those tournaments) and has been captain for England in 7 matches.

As of December 2007, Owen has never gone more than four international games in a row without scoring a goal. Owen's future as first choice striker for England is uncertain however, due to competition from Manchester United's Wayne Rooney and fast-developing Theo Walcott amongst others. Owen's lack of action in Fabio Capello's first two England friendlies and Capello's selection of a single striker 4-5-1 formation also support the view that Owen's international opportunities may in future be limited.

2008 was a tough year for Owen as he was excluded from World Cup qualifiers against Andorra, Croatia, Kazakhstan and Belarus despite at times being in good goalscoring form and having a good workrate in a poor Newcastle side.Many fans and pundits have called for Owen to be reinstated in the national team but whether Capello will select him still remains to be seen.He was once again left out of the squad for the friendly against Germany in November 2008, despite forwards Emile Heskey and Wayne Rooney being unavailable for the match. However Capello stated in November 2008 that Owen could still be reinstated to the side at some point in the future.

Owen's chances of an international recall deteriorated when Capello announced he would only pick Owen if he was playing regularly. Having been used mainly as a substitute by United, by February 2010 he described his chances of a recall as "probably a long shot in racing terms", and on 5 March, after being ruled out for the rest of the season with a hamstring injury sustained during the 2010 Football League Cup Final, his chances of going to the World Cup finals in South Africa looked to have come to an end.

PROFILE:
Full name : Alan Shearer
Date of birth : 13 August 1970 
Place of birth : Newcastle upon Tyne, England
Height: 6 ft 0 in 
Playing position : Striker

Mini Bio:
Alan Shearer OBE, DL (born 13 August 1970) is a retired English footballer. He played as a striker in the top level of English league football for Southampton, Blackburn Rovers, Newcastle United and for the England national team. He is widely considered as one of the greatest English strikers of all time, being both Newcastle's and the Premier League's record goalscorer. After retiring as a player, Shearer now works as a television pundit for the BBC. Toward the end of his playing career, Shearer worked towards gaining the UEFA Pro Licence, and expressed a desire to eventually become a manager. In 2009 he briefly left his BBC role to become Newcastle United's manager in the last eight games of their 2008ñ09 season, in an unsuccessful attempt to save them from relegation.

A native of Newcastle upon Tyne, Shearer made his professional debut with English top-flight club Southampton in 1988, scoring a hat-trick in the process. During several years on the south coast, he became known for his classic style of play, strength and goalscoring ability; he soon received an international call-up along with a transfer to Blackburn Rovers in 1992. Shearer established himself as a player in northern England; he became a regular in the England squad, and his 34-goal tally helped Blackburn secure the Premier League title in 1994ñ95. He was named Football Writers' Association Player of the Year in 1994 and won the PFA Player of the Year award in 1995. The 1995ñ96 season saw Shearer make his first Champions League appearances and finish as the top scorer in the Premier League with 31 goals. He was also top scorer at Euro 1996 with England, scoring five goals, and in the 1996ñ97 Premier League, with 25 goals.

A world-record £15 million move to his boyhood heroes, Newcastle United, followed the Euro '96 tournament, and Shearer spent the remainder of his career with the club. While he would never emulate the success of his time at Blackburn Rovers, Shearer won runners-up medals in the Premier League and FA Cup with Newcastle, and a second PFA Player of the Year award. After being named England's captain in 1996 and Newcastle's captain in 1999, he retired from international football following Euro 2000, having amassed 63 appearances and 30 goals for his country.

As well as his media work, he has raised substantial amounts of money for various national and local charities, both within and outside of sports. Shearer is an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE), a Deputy Lieutenant of Northumberland, a Freeman of Newcastle upon Tyne and an honorary Doctor of Civil Law of Northumbria and Newcastle Universities.

Shearer's international career began in 1990 when he was handed a callup to the England under-21 squad under Dave Sexton. During his time with the squad, he scored 13 times in 11 games; a record return which is still unbeaten. The striker's goals at this level, coupled with his club form, meant he was soon promoted to the senior squad by coach Graham Taylor. Marking his debut in the 2ñ0 win against France in February 1992 with a goal,he made his only appearance for the England B team a month later. Due to replace Gary Lineker, who retired in 1992, in the England attack,

Shearer played only intermittently in the qualifying campaign for the 1994 FIFA World Cup due to injury and the team failed to reach the competition finals.

Euro 96 was a more positive experience for both Shearer and England. With England not required to qualify as hosts, Shearer had not scored in 12 games in the 21 months prior, but found the net in the 22nd minute of the first game, against Switzerland. Scoring once in the following game against Scotland and twice in a 4ñ1 win over the Netherlands, Shearer helped England to progress to the next stage in front of their own fans in Wembley.

In the quarter finals, England were outplayed by Spain but got through to a penalty shootout after a goalless draw. Shearer scored the first England penalty,while the Spaniards failed to score from two of theirs, sending England into the semi-final against Germany. Shearer headed England into the lead after three minutes, but the Germans quickly equalised and the match went to penalties again. This time, Germany won from the spot; although Shearer scored, his team-mate Gareth Southgate missed his kick and England were eliminated. Shearer's five goals made him the competition's top scorer,and together with team mates David Seaman and Steve McManaman, was listed in the official UEFA team of the tournament.

The new England manager Glenn Hoddle appointed Shearer squad captain for the 1998 FIFA World Cup qualifier against Moldova on 1 September 1996, and the player held onto the captaincy after scoring once in that match and twice in the following game against Poland. He scored a total of five goals in England's successful qualification campaign for the 1998 FIFA World Cup; adding strikes against Georgia and away to Poland to his tally.Shearer was sidelined for much of the 1997ñ98 season,but recovered to play in the World Cup finals. With Michael Owen replacing Teddy Sheringham as Shearer's strike partner, Shearer's return saw him score England's first goal of the tournament, in a 2ñ0 win over Tunisia, his only goal in the three group matches.England faced long-time rivals Argentina in the second round. Shearer scored a first-half equaliser from the penalty-spot before David Beckham was sent off early in the second half. In the final minutes of the game Sol Campbell headed in what could have been the winning goal only for the referee to disallow it due to Shearer having elbowed goalkeeper Carlos Roa. The scores tied 2-2, the game went to penalties. Shearer scored again, but England were eliminated after David Batty's shot was saved by the Argentina goalkeeper. This defeat ended England's participation in what was to be Shearer's only World Cup tournament.

In September 1999, Shearer scored his only England hat-trick in a Euro 2000 qualifier against Luxembourg.This helped England reach a play-off against Scotland; England won the game over two legs and in doing so qualified for the European Championships. By now, Shearer was approaching his 30th birthday, and he announced that he intended to retire from international football after the Euro 2000 tournament.

Shearer did not score in England's opening 3ñ2 defeat against Portugal, but did so as England defeated Germany 1ñ0 in Charleroi, ensuring that England beat their European neighbours for the first time since the 1966 World Cup Final. To remain in the tournament, England only required a draw against Romania in the final group match, and Shearer scored a penalty as England went in at half-time 2ñ1 up, but Romania ultimately won 3ñ2. England's tournament was over, and so was Shearer's international career. From his 63 caps, he captained the team 34 times and scored thirty goals;joint-fifth in the England all-time goalscorers list with Nat Lofthouse and Tom Finney.Shearer remained in international retirement despite speculation of a return during the 2002 World Cup and 2004 European Championship campaigns, and further declined an offer to be assistant manager to Steve McClaren after the 2006 World Cup - a position ultimately filled by Terry Venables.

Date of birth : 7 September 1968 
Place of birth : Accra, Ghana
Height : 1.88 m 
Playing position : Defender, midfielder

Mini Bio:
Marcel Desailly  is a retired French footballer and star of the France national football team squad, with whom he won the 1998 World Cup and Euro 2000. He also enjoyed a distinguished career at club level with several major European clubs.

Desailly made his international debut in 1993, but was not established as a first choice defender until 1996. He was an important part of the French team which won the 1998 World Cup, albeit being sent off in the final. Like other team members, he was made Chevalier (Knight) of the Legion d'honneur in 1998.Two years later success continued, as France won Euro 2000. After the tournament, Desailly was made captain of the national team, following the retirement of Didier Deschamps. In 2001, he led France to victory in the Confederations Cup.

In April 2003, Desailly surpassed the record for the number of appearances for the French team, a number which eventually reached 116 when he announced his retirement from international football following Euro 2004. However, that record was broken during the 2006 World Cup by Lilian Thuram

Desailly is considered one of the most accomplished players of the game and one of the best players of the past two decades, having won virtually every major team award. He is currently a UNICEF ambassador to Ghana and is being mentioned as a possible candidate for the coaching position of Ghana's national team.

Following retirement, Desailly became a pundit for BBC Sport predominantly giving his opinion from the touchline at both half time and full time as opposed to residing in the studio with Alan Hansen, Alan Shearer and Martin O'Neill.

He worked for BBC Sport in the United Kingdom during the 2006 World Cup, as one of their Match of the Day analysts. He developed a small but devout fanbase, entertained by his inability to contribute without shouting at the top of his voice, at great length, often about trivial issues.

He also worked for BBC Sport at the 2008 Africa Cup of Nations and Euro 2008 and is a regular commentator for French television channel Canal Plus.

He also become a spokesperson for sports betting website Betclic.

In 2010 Desailly joined the ITV Sport team for their World Cup coverage from South Africa.

PROFILE:
Full name : Didier Claude Deschamps
Date of birth : October 15, 1968 
Place of birth : Bayonne, France
Playing position : Defensive midfielder

Mini Bio:
Didier Claude Deschamps  born 15 October 1968 in Bayonne is a retired French footballer and current manager of Marseille. He played as a Defensive midfielder. As an international, he assisted France with victories in the 1998 World Cup and Euro 2000.

Receiving his first international call-up from Michel Platini in 1989 (on April 29 against Yugoslavia), Deschamps started his international career in what was a dark time for the French team as they failed to qualify for the World Cup in both 1990 and 1994.

When new team coach Aime Jacquet began to rebuild the team for Euro 1996, he initially selected Eric Cantona as captain. After Cantona earned a year-long suspension in January 1995, the make-up of the team changed dramatically, with veterans Cantona, Jean-Pierre Papin, and David Ginola being dropped in favour of younger players such as Zinedine Zidane. Deschamps, as one of the few remaining veterans, was chosen to lead what would later be called the "Golden Generation". He first captained France in 1996 in a friendly match against Germany as a warmup for Euro 96. During that tournament, held in England, he led them all the way to the semi-finals, their best finish in an international tournament since the 1986 World Cup.

In 1998, Deschamps captained France as they won 1998 World Cup on home soil in Paris, holding an integral role in the team. Propelled by the momentum of this triumph, Deschamps also captained France as they won Euro 2000, giving them the distinction of being the first national team to hold both the World Cup and Euro titles since West Germany did so in 1974. France held the top position in the FIFA World Rankings system from 2001ñ02.

In total, Deschamps earned 103 caps and scored four goals. Deschamps was named by Pele as one of the top 125 greatest living footballers in March 2004.

After retiring as a player, he went into football management. He was the head coach of Monaco in France's Ligue 1, leading Monaco to the French League Cup title in 2002ñ03 and to its first UEFA Champions League final in 2004. He resigned on 19 September 2005 after a poor start to the season, and disagreement with club's president.

Place of birth : Marrakech, French Morocco
Height : 1.74 m 
Playing position : Striker

Mini Bio:
He holds the record for most goals scored in a single FIFA World Cup finals tournament, with thirteen in 1958. He has also scored the third most goals of any player in the World Cup finals overall, beaten only by Gerd M¸ller, who scored fourteen goals (in two World Cup tournaments), and Ronaldo, who scored fifteen goals (in three World Cup tournaments). Although France did not win the 1958 World Cup, Fontaine became the second player after Alcides Ghiggia to score in every match of a World Cup.

Though born in Marrakech, he moved to Casablanca, where he attended the Lycee Lyautey.

Fontaine began his amateur career at USM Casablanca, where he played from 1950 to 1953. Nice recruited him in 1953, and he went on to score 44 goals in three seasons for the club. In 1956, he moved on to Stade de Reims where he teamed up with Raymond Kopa, Kopa went to Real Madrid in 1958, Fontaine scored 121 goals in six seasons at the Stade de Reims. In total, Fontaine scored 165 goals in 200 matches in the Ligue 1, and twice won the championship; in 1958 and 1960.

Wearing the blue shirt of France, Fontaine's statistics are even more impressive. On his debut with the team on 17 December 1953, Fontaine scored a hat trick as France defeated Luxembourg 8-0. In seven years, he scored 30 goals in 21 matches for the national team. However, Fontaine will best be remembered for his 1958 FIFA World Cup performance, where he scored 13 goals in just six matchesóa feat which included putting four past the defending champions West Germany. It was also the highest number of goals ever scored by one player at a single World Cup tournament - a record which still stands today. This tally secured him the Golden Boot for that tournament.

Fontaine played his last match in July 1962, being forced to retire early because of a recurring injury. He briefly managed the French national team in 1967, but was replaced after only two games, both friendlies that ended in defeats. As coach of Morocco, he led the Atlas Lions to 3rd in the 1980 African Cup of Nations, overseeing the emergence of such players as Badou Zaki, Mohammed Timoumi and Aziz Bouderbala. Morocco reached the final stage of 1982 World Cup qualifying but were beaten by Cameroon.

He was named by PelÈ as one of the 125 greatest living footballers in March 2004. He was chosen as the best French player of the last 50 years by the French Football Federation in the UEFA Jubilee Awards in November 2003.

With Eugene NJo Lea he founded the National Union of Professional Football Players in 1961.

<p>Thierry Henry</p>
<i>
PROFILE:
Full name : Thierry Daniel Henry
Date of birth : 17 August 1977 
Place of birth : Les Ulis, Essonne, France
Height : 1.88 m 
Playing position : Striker/Winger

Mini Bio:
Henry was born in Les Ulis, Essonne (a suburb of Paris) where he played for an array of local sides as a youngster and showed great promise as a goal-scorer. He was spotted by AS Monaco in 1990 and signed instantly, making his professional debut in 1994. Good form led to an international call-up in 1998, after which he signed for the Serie A defending champions Juventus. He had a disappointing season playing on the wing, before joining Arsenal for £10.5 million in 1999.

It was at Arsenal that Henry made his name as a world-class footballer. Despite initially struggling in the Premier League, he emerged as Arsenal's top goal-scorer for almost every season of his tenure there. Under long-time mentor and coach ArsËne Wenger, Henry became a prolific striker and Arsenal's all-time leading scorer with 226 goals in all competitions. The Frenchman won two league titles and three FA Cups with the Gunners; he was twice nominated for the FIFA World Player of the Year, was named the PFA Players' Player of the Year twice, and the Football Writers' Association Footballer of the Year three times. Henry spent his final two seasons with Arsenal as club captain, leading them to the UEFA Champions League final in 2006. In June 2007, after eight years with Arsenal, he transferred to Barcelona for a fee of Ä24 million. His first honours with the Catalan club came in 2009 when they won the league, cup and Champions League treble. Later he would go on to achieve an unprecedented sextuple by also winning the Spanish Supercup, the UEFA Supercup and the Club World Cup. Henry has been named in the UEFA Team of the Year five times.

Henry has enjoyed similar success with the French national squad, having won the 1998 World Cup, Euro 2000 and 2003 FIFA Confederations Cup. In October 2007, he surpassed Michel Platini's record to become France's top goal-scorer of all time. Off the pitch, as a result of his own experience, Henry is an active spokesperson against racism in football. He married English model Nicole Merry in 2003 and had a daughter with her, but they divorced in 2007. Henry is also one of the top commercially marketed footballers; he was ranked ninth in the world in 2006.

Henry has had a successful career with the France national team. His international career began in June 1997, when his good form for Monaco was rewarded with a call-up to the Under-20 French national team, where he played in the 1997 FIFA World Youth Championship alongside future teammates William Gallas and David Trezeguet. Within four months, France head coach AimÈ Jacquet called Henry up to the senior team. The 20-year-old made his senior international debut on 11 October 1997 in a 2ñ1 win against South Africa.Jacquet was so impressed with Henry that he took him to the 1998 World Cup. Although Henry was a largely unknown quantity at international level, he ended the tournament as France's top scorer with three goals. He was scheduled to appear as a substitute in the final, where France beat Brazil 3ñ0, but Marcel Desailly's sending off forced a defensive change instead. In 1998, he was made Chevalier (Knight) of the Legion dhonneur, France's highest decoration.

Henry was a member of France's Euro 2000 championship squad, again scoring three goals in the tournament, including the equalizer against Portugal in the semi-final, and finishing as the country's top scorer.France later won the game in extra time following a converted penalty kick by Zinedine Zidane. France went on to defeat Italy in extra time in the final, earning Henry his second major international medal.During the tournament, Henry was voted man-of-the-match in three games, including the final against Italy.

The 2002 FIFA World Cup featured a stunning early exit for both Henry and France as the defending champions were eliminated in the group stage after failing to score a goal in all three games.France lost their first match in group play and Henry was red carded for a dangerous sliding challenge in their next match against Uruguay.In that game, France played to a 0ñ0 draw, but Henry was forced to miss the final match due to suspension; France lost 2ñ0 to Denmark.

Henry returned to form for his country at the 2003 Confederations Cup. Despite playing without team stalwarts Zidane and Patrick Vieira, France won, in large part owing to Henry's outstanding play, for which he was named Man of the Match by FIFA's Technical Study Group in three of France's five matches.In the final, he scored the golden goal in extra time to lift the title for the host country after a 1ñ0 victory over Cameroon.Henry was awarded both the adidas Golden Ball as the outstanding player of the competition and the adidas Golden Shoe as the tournament's top goal-scorer with four goals.

In Euro 2004, Henry played in all of France's matches and scored two goals.France beat England in the group stages but lost to the eventual winners Greece 1ñ0 in the quarter-finals.During the 2006 FIFA World Cup Henry remained as one of the automatic starters in the squad. He played as a lone striker, but despite an indifferent start to the tournament, became one of the top players of the World Cup. He scored three goals, including the winning goal from Zidane's free kick against defending champions Brazil. However, France subsequently lost to Italy on penalties (5ñ3) in the final. Henry did not take part in the penalty shootout, having been substituted in extra time after his legs had cramped.Henry was one of 10 nominees for the Golden Ball award for Player of the Tournament, an award which was ultimately presented to his teammate, Zidane and was named a starting striker on the 2006 FIFPro World XI team.

On 13 October 2007, Henry scored his 41st goal against the Faroe Islands, joining Michel Platini as the country's top goal-scorer of all time. Four days later at the Stade de la Beaujoire, he scored a late double against Lithuania, thereby setting a new record as France's top goal-scorer.On 3 June 2008, Henry made his 100th appearance for national team in match against Colombia, becoming the sixth French player ever to reach that milestone.

Henry missed the opening game of France's short-lived Euro 2008 campaign, where they were eliminated in the group stages after being grouped together with Italy, the Netherlands and Romania. He scored France's only goal in the competition in a 4ñ1 loss to the Netherlands.

Mini Bio:
Raymond Kopa (born Kopaszewski, on October 13, 1931 in Núux-les-Mines, Pas-de-Calais), is a former French football striker, integral to the French national team of the 1950s. He was a great and versatile playmaker, who also scored plenty of goals.

Kopa began his professional career at the age of 17 with SCO Angers in France's second level, and was transferred two years later to Stade de Reims, with whom he won French championships in 1953 and 1955. He helped Reims reach the first European Cup final in 1956, which the team lost to Alfredo Di Stefano's Real Madrid, 4-3.

Kopa was transferred to Real Madrid the subsequent season, where he was soon joined by Ferenc Pusk·s. At Real Madrid, Kopa won the Spanish league in 1957 and 1958. Kopa also became the first French player to win the European Cup when Madrid defeated Fiorentina 2-0 in the 1957 final. He would go on to be European champion again in 1958 and 1959, the last against former side Stade de Reims, where Just Fontaine played.

In the 1959-60 season, Kopa returned to France to finish his career with Reims, where he won further Championnats in 1960 and 1962. In total, he scored 75 goals in 346 matches in France's top flight, and was given the Ballon d'or by France Football in 1958.

With the France national football team, Kopa scored 18 goals in 45 games between 1952 and 1962. He played in the 1958 FIFA World Cup in Sweden, where the French team finished third, losing to the Brazilian team.

PROFILE:
Full name : Jean-Pierre Papin
Date of birth :November 5, 1963 
Place of birth : Boulogne-sur-Mer, France
Playing position : Striker

Mini Bio:
Jean-Pierre Papin (born November 5, 1963 in Boulogne-sur-Mer) is a French professional football player who was European Footballer of the Year in 1991.

Papin achieved his greatest success while playing for Olympique Marseille between 1986 and 1992. He later played for AC Milan, Bayern Munich, Bordeaux and Guingamp (1998 to 1999) then he went to JS Saint-Pierroise and spent 2 years at the club between (1999 to 2001) then he left to go to US Cap-Ferret and spent 3 years at the club between (2001 and 2004). Then in January 2009 he got out the football boots again at the age of 45 years old to play for AS Facture-Biganos Boiens where he still plays for them to this day. Papin also played 54 times for the French national team. After a short time as manager of French clubs, he joined the local amateur club AS Facture-Biganos Boien as a player in 2009, aged 45.

During Papin's hugely successful spell at Olympique Marseille, with the Frenchman as striker and team leader Marseille won four French league championships in a row (1989ñ1992), a French league and cup double in 1989 and reached the final of the European Champions Cup in 1991, losing to Red Star Belgrade after a penalty shootout. During this period, Papin was the French league's top scorer for five consecutive seasons (from 1988 to 1992). While at Marseille he won the Ballon dor, awarded to Europe's top footballer, in 1991. He is the only player to win this award while playing for a French club.

In 1992 Papin joined Italian giants AC Milan for a world record fee of £10,000,000, and was the first high-profile French player to join the Italian league since Michel Platini. However, he never established himself as a regular first team member with the rossoneri due to injuries and adaptation problems. He entered as a substitute during the 1993 UEFA Champions League Final where Milan lost to his former club, Marseille. Nevertheless, Papin has kept good memories of his spell in Italy and frequently cites former Milan managers Fabio Capello and Arrigo Sacchi as his models when coaching is concerned. In 1994, he was transferred to Bayern Munich where his season was again plagued by injuries. In his second season in Germany he was part of the side that won the UEFA Cup against Girondins de Bordeaux, a club that Papin would join the following season. With Bordeaux, he lost the final of the 1997 Coupe de la Ligue against Strasbourg. Papin's career ended in 1998 with Second Division side EA Guingamp.

Papin was a prolific striker on the French scene but, contrary to many other French great players, never really became dominant abroad. He was also part of the 'cursed generation' of French players that came between the Platini era of the 80's and the 1998 world champions boasting the likes of Zidane, Thuram, Henry and company. Despite some talented players like Papin, …ric Cantona or David Ginola the French national team fared disappointingly, missing the 1990 and 1994 World Cups ñ the later after two humiliating defeats at home against Israel and Bulgaria ñ and being ousted in the group stage of Euro 1992 by Denmark after a perfect record in the qualifications. It was the only period (1989ñ1996) in French football where clubs actually did better than the national team.

<p>Roberto Pires</p>

PROFILE:
Full name : Robert Emmanuel Pires
Date of birth : 29 October 1973 
Place of birth : Reims, France
Height : 1.87 m 
Playing position : Winger / Attacking midfielder

Mini Bio:
Robert Emmanuel Pires (born 29 October 1973 in Reims) is a French footballer who currently plays as a winger. He normally plays on the left wing but can play all across the midfield or in a position to support the striker(s). He is of Portuguese and Spanish descent.

Pires was part of France's 1998 World Cup and Euro 2000 winning squads (Pires laid on the pass for David Trezeguet's winning goal in the final), but had to miss the 2002 World Cup due to an injury he sustained playing for Arsenal. He also played in 1996 Olympic Games and Euro 2004. However, a dispute in late 2004 with French national coach Raymond Domenech put a halt to PirËs' international career. He won 79 caps for his country and scored 14 goals. He won the Golden Ball (for most outstanding football) and Golden Shoe (for most goals scored) awards at the 2001 Confederations Cup in Korea/Japan.

France
During his six seasons there, he scored 43 goals in 162 matches, and won the Coupe de la Ligue, prompting a £5 million move to Olympique de Marseille in 1998. At Marseille, PirËs had a mixed two-year stay. His first season saw Marseille miss the French league title by a point and they also lost the 1999 UEFA Cup Final to Parma. His second season saw him suffer a spate of on- and off-field problems, which led him to boycott the club at the season's end.

Arsenal
Pires was signed by Arsenal for £6 million in 2000, after stiff competition from Real Madrid and Juventus, replacing Marc Overmars, who had left for FC Barcelona for a record £25 million.Initially, PirËs' form was indifferent, and some people criticised him after his comments that the English game was too physical. However, he slowly began to regain the form he had shown at Metz, scoring a superb solo goal against S.S. Lazio in the 2000ñ01 Champions League,and the winner against Tottenham Hotspur in the FA Cup semi-finals. However, Arsenal went on to lose the Cup final to Liverpool 2ñ1.

By 2001ñ02, Pires had fully got to grips with the English game and had one of his best seasons. Pires scored some superb goals against Middlesbrough and Aston Villa. Against Aston Villa, Pires chased after a long ball by Freddie Ljungberg, and lobbed the ball over the pursuing George Boateng, and finished off the move with a delightful chip over Peter Schmeichel. He led the Premiership assist charts and was voted both FWA Footballer of the Year and Arsenal's player of the season, as Arsenal won the league title. This was despite not playing the last two months of the season after suffering a cruciate ligament injury in a FA Cup match against Newcastle United.

After a lengthy layoff, PirËs made his comeback in November 2002 as a substitute against AJ Auxerre in the UEFA Champions League. Initially, PirËs found it tough, but he finally found his form, scoring 14 Premiership goals in 20 starts that season, including a hat-trick against Southampton in the penultimate day of the season. PirËs was voted Barclaycard Player of the Month for February 2003. Pirrs capped off his season by scoring the winning goal in the FA Cup Final against Southampton.

He went on to be a crucial part of Arsenal's quest for the Premiership title in the 2003ñ04 season, which they achieved, remaining unbeaten and becoming the first English top flight club to do so in 115 years. Pires and his Arsenal teammate Thierry Henry were instrumental in that season, scoring a combined 57 goals in all competitions. PirËs made a sluggish start to the campaign, but a wonder-goal against Liverpool at Anfield kick-started his season. PirËs showed football fans his sublime technique, skills and finishing, most notably with his goals against Liverpool, Bolton Wanderers, and Leeds United. He surprised a lot of people with a world class tackle on Claude MakÈlÈlÈ and, following that, a run into the penalty box which dragged William Gallas and John Terry away, thus making space for Patrick Vieira to have a one-on-one with the Chelsea goalkeeper and subsequently scoring. Arsenal won that match 2ñ1, with Vieira's goal the equaliser. That day of Premier League action proved decisive, as Manchester United's failure to beat Leeds United during the same day resulted in Arsenal getting a huge lead in the title race. Arsenal never lost 1st place in the table for the rest of the season. More notably, PirËs will always be remembered for a game in the UEFA Champions League quarter-final's 1st leg match against Chelsea, where he managed to beat John Terry to a header, which resulted in the equaliser for Arsenal, after Eiur Gujohnsen had given Chelsea the lead. Unfortunately for Arsenal and PirËs, they were eliminated after they lost 1ñ2 in the return leg, courtesy of a 87th minute Wayne Bridge goal. PirËs also showed his playmaking skills in the wonderfully crafted goal against Tottenham Hotspur at White Hart Lane, in which Pires was the architect in building up the goal, and capped off the move with a sublime finish to score Arsenal's 2nd goal of the game. Tottenham refused to give up, and managed to claw their way back and claimed a 2ñ2 draw. Despite that, Arsenal won the title after the match. Pires finished that season with an impressive tally of 74 goals and seven assists in the English Premier League. He was Arsenal's second top scorer (behind Thierry Henry) and had the joint amount of assists (along with Dennis Bergkamp) that season.

In the 2004ñ05 season, PirËs finished third in the Premiership goalscorers table with 14 goals, behind teammate Thierry Henry and Crystal Palace's Andrew Johnson. Pires also picked up a second FA Cup winners' medal after Arsenal beat Manchester United on penalties. Pires was replaced by Edu in the 2nd half of extra time in that match.

During the 2005ñ06 season, PirËs wrangled with Arsenal over a new contract, in the hope of a new two-year deal. In keeping with the club's policy regarding players over 30, Pires was only offered a 12-month extension to his contract, which expired in June 2006. Pires started the season poorly, and players such as Freddie Ljungberg, Jose Antonio Reyes and Alexander Hleb were preferred to him on both wings. As the season progressed, though, Pires's form improved, outscoring his selection rivals overall. Pires played his last game for Arsenal in the UEFA Champions league final against FC Barcelona, in which he was substituted after goalkeeper Jens Lehmann's sending off during the match. Pires ended the season as Arsenal's joint second top scorer along with Robin van Persie.

PROFILE:
Full name :Michel Francois Platini
Date of birth :June 21, 1955 
Place of birth :Júuf, France
Height : 1.78 m 
Playing position : Attacking midfielder

Mini Bio:
Michel Francois Platini (born 21 June 1955) is a French former football player, manager and current president of UEFA. Platini was a member of the French national team that won the 1984 European Championship, a tournament in which he was voted the best player and top goalscorer. He participated in the 1978, 1982 and 1986 World Cups, reaching the semi-finals in the latter two. Platini, Alain Giresse, Luis Fern·ndez and Jean Tigana together made up the "carre magique" (French for "magic square"), the group of midfield players that formed the heart of the French national team throughout the 1980s. He is also widely regarded as one of the best passers in football history as well as one of history's greatest free kick specialists and finishers. He holds the record for most goals  scored in European Championship final tournaments despite only appearing in one such tournament (1984). Despite being a midfielder, he held the national team top scorer record until striker Thierry Henry surpassed the 41 goals mark in 2007.

Platini was named Chevalier of the Legion of Honour on 29 April 1985 and became Officier in 1988. He was the French national team coach for four years, and was the co-organizer of the 1998 World Cup in France. He has also been the chairman of the FIFA Technical and Development Committee, and vice-president of the French Football Federation. His Italian father Aldo was also a professional footballer and a long-time director for AS Nancy, the club where Michel started his professional career.

Having first attracted the attention of national team selectors in the Coupe Gambardella tournament, Platini was selected for the French junior team, but injuries prevented him from playing. He made his first appearance for a French national selection playing for the French amateur side on 26 September 1973.

Platini began his military service in summer 1975. He was assigned to the Joinville battalion, as were all talented French sportspeople fulfilling their military obligations. His colleagues in the battalion included his Nancy team-mates Olivier Rouyer and Jean-Michel Moutier, as well as Maxime Bossis, soon to become a regular in the French national team along with Platini. Platini would turn out for the French military team, in addition to representing the French under-23s and the French Olympic team. He impressed in the Olympic team's 4ñ0 win over Romania in Brest, a result made even more impressive by the fact that Romania had fielded a full international side for the Olympic qualifier. Platini's performance made him a star in France. The away leg of the qualifying tie was a mere formality, France coming away with a 1ñ1 draw. Three days after the draw in Bucharest, Platini received his first call-up to the A national team for what was coach Michel Hidalgo's first game in charge, a friendly against Czechoslovakia in Paris (27 March 1976, 2ñ2), and scored his first international goal on one of his trademark free kicks.

In 1976 Olympics, Platini was a member of the French football team at the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal. Their tournament began on 19 July with an easy 4ñ0 win over Mexico. They registered another 4ñ0 win in their next match against Guatemala, with two goals from Platini. The French team completed the group stage with a draw against Israel, Platini scoring from a penalty. France progressed to the quarter-final stage, where they would face a full-strength East German national team. Hindered by some dubious refereeing,[citation needed] France lost 4ñ0 and finished the match with nine men.

Prior to 1978 World Cup,With a 3ñ1 win over Bulgaria at the Parc des Princes on 16 November 1977, a match in which Platini excelled in the role of playmaker and scored on a splendid 25-metre shot, France secured qualification for the 1978 World Cup in Argentina for their first appearance in the World Cup finals since 1966. In the month following the decisive qualifying match, Platini finished third in the voting for the 1977 European Footballer of the Year.

Among the international friendlies France played in preparation for the World Cup, their match against Italy in Naples on 8 February 1978 (2ñ2) was particularly significant for Platini. With a number of scouts from Italian clubs in attendance, he was in excellent form. He beat Italian goalkeeping legend Dino Zoff from two direct free-kicks, the first being ruled out because the referee had not blown his whistle. The re-taken free-kick was blocked by the defensive wall, but minutes later Platini had the ball in the Italian net from another free-kick. Zoff attempted to anticipate the flight of the ball by positioning himself on the left side of the goal, only for Platini to find the unguarded area of the net with his free-kick, leaving Zoff rooted to the spot. Platini's duels with Zoff and his performance in a match that was broadcast on Italian television made him a name in Italy. A number of clubs both in France (Paris Saint-Germain and Saint-…tienne) and across Europe (Juventus, Internazionale, Napoli, Barcelona, Valencia, and Arsenal, to name a few) began the clamour for his services.

In 1978 World Cup,In retrospect, this match may have been a Pyrrhic victory because Platini's brilliance drew the attention of Italy coach Enzo Bearzot, who devised a successful plan to contain him in a match-up that really matteredóthe first round of the 1978 World Cup four months later. Platini was kept in check by Marco Tardelli's implacable marking and Italy won 2ñ1. Drawn in a difficult group with Italy as well as hosts (and eventual winners) Argentina, France did not survive the first round.

In Road to Spain '82 and the World Cup,Platini was nonetheless made captain of the French national side after the World Cup and made the number 10 jersey his own. One of his trademark free-kicks helped France defeat the Netherlands 2ñ0 in Paris (18 November 1981) in a crucial qualifying match for the 1982 World Cup in Spain.

France unexpectedly reached the semifinals of the 1982 World Cup where they met West Germany in Seville for what proved to be one of the great matches of World Cup history. German goalkeeper Harald Schumacher had collided with Patrick Battiston, leaving the Frenchman knocked-out cold, and the referee did not call a penalty, much to the anger of the French. With both sides level at 3ñ3 after extra time had been played (Platini having scored France's first goal of the game from a penalty) the match went to a penalty shoot-out which West Germany won 5ñ4. Interestingly, Platini would consider this match the greatest memory of his career.

In Euro '84,In 1984, Platini captained France to success in the European Championship on home soil. His individual impact on the tournament was huge with nine of France's 14 goals in just five games (the top goal scorer in Euro). He scored the winner in France's opening match against Denmark, and scored two "perfect" hat-tricks (one header and one goal with each foot) against Belgium and Yugoslavia, as France topped their first-round group with three wins out of three. In the dramatic semi-final in Marseille against Portugal, Platini scored the final goal of the match for a memorable 3ñ2 win in the last minute of extra time. In the final against Spain, he opened the scoring with a free kick-goal, helped by a monumental blunder from Spain goalkeeper Luis Arconada. A second goal from Bruno Bellone in injury time at the end of the match secured France's first major title in international football.

In Mexico '86,Suffering from groin pain and playing under injection, Platini was not in peak physical condition for the 1986 World Cup in Mexico. Nonetheless he contributed two important goals. The first contributed to their 2ñ0 defeat of defending champions Italy. The second came during the quarterfinal match against Brazil. After Careca scored for Brazil, Platini scored the equalizer, his 41st on his 31st birthday, which sent the game into a penalty shoot-out. France won 4ñ3, with Platini famously sending his over the bar. This goal was to be the last of his international career. After losing a second World Cup semi-final in a row to West Germany, France had to settle for third place. Platini did not take part in the 1982 or 1986 World Cup third-place matches.

At Retirement,Platini made his last appearance for France on 29 April 1987, in a European Championship qualifier at home to Iceland, a few weeks before announcing his retirement from all football. In 72 appearances for France from 1976 to 1987, including 49 appearances as captain, Platini scored 41 times, a record for the French national team, which has since only been surpassed by Barcelona striker Thierry Henry after scoring his 42nd and 43rd national team goals against Lithuania in a Euro 2008 qualifying match on 17 October 2007.

Mini Bio:
Lilian Thuram (born Ruddy Lilian Thuram-Ulien on 1 January 1972 in Pointe-a-Pitre) is a retired French professional football defender and is the most capped player in the history of the France national team. He played at the top flight in France, Italy and Spain for over 15 seasons, including ten in the Serie A with both Juventus and Parma FC. With France, Thuram won the 1998 World Cup and the Euro 2000. Thuram holds the record for most appearances at the European Championship, with 16.

After becoming world champion in 1998, Thuram was an integral part of France's triumph at Euro 2000, which led to the team being ranked by FIFA as number one from 2001-2002. He also played in the 2002 World Cup, 2006 World Cup, Euro 96, Euro 2004, and Euro 2008

In 1998 World Cup,Thuram scored only two international goals, both of which came in one game ñ the 1998 World Cup semi-final against Croatia, in which France came back to win 2ñ1 and advance to the final. France defeated Brazil 3ñ0 to capture their inaugural World Cup and Thuram won the Bronze Ball as the third most valuable player in the tournament. He, Bixente Lizarazu, Laurent Blanc and Marcel Desailly formed the backbone of the French defence that conceded only 2 goals in seven games.

In 2006 World Cup,After a brief international retirement, France coach Raymond Domenech convinced Thuram to return to the French team on 17 August 2005, along with fellow "Golden Generation" teammates Zinedine Zidane and Claude MakÈlÈlÈ, as Les Bleus struggled to qualify for the 2006 World Cup. Thuram's centre-back partnership with William Gallas was to be the foundation for France's progression to the final. Thuram earned his 116th cap for France in the group stage match against South Korea in Leipzig on 18 June 2006. In that game he equalled Desailly's record number of caps, which he broke in the final group stage match, a 2ñ0 win over Togo in Cologne on 23 June 2006, winning his 117th cap. He was named the Man of the match in France's semi-final 1ñ0 victory against Portugal, coincidentally the same distinction he had earned eight years earlier at the semi-finals of the 1998 World Cup.

In Euro 2008,On 9 June 2008, Thuram took the field against Romania in a group match, and became the first player to make 15 UEFA European Championship finals appearances. The former record of 14 appearances was held by Zinedine Zidane, LuÌs Figo and Karel Poborsky.He played one more game during the tournament, raising the number of his appearances to 16, which record was then equaled a few days later by Edwin van der Sar from the Netherlands in the quarter-finals. Thuram was the captain of France in the tournament. He, along with Claude Makelele, announced his retirement from international football on 17 June 2008, after France's 2-0 loss to Italy. He finished his career with the national team as France's most capped player with 142 caps.

<p>David Trezeguet</p>
<i>
PROFILE:
David Sergio Trezeguet is a World Cup winning French football striker, who plays for Juventus in the Italian Serie A.

Of Argentine descent, Trezeguet played for the French national team, the country of his birth.

In 1997, Trezeguet scored the fastest goal ever in terms of velocity in UEFA Champions League history in a quarter-final match against Manchester United. The shot that resulted in a goal was clocked at 97.76 mp/h (157.33 km/h). In the 2003 UEFA Champions League Final, Trezeguet was one of the three Juventus players to have their penalty saved by AC Milan keeper Dida in penalties. He also scored the 3000th goal in UEFA Champions League history (since it's inception in 1992) by netting against Olympiacos in a 7-0 romp in 2004.

Trezeguet first competed internationally on the French youth squad alongside senior squad teammates Thierry Henry, Willy Sagnol, and William Gallas, and played in the 1997 FIFA World Youth Championship. In the 1998 World Cup, younger players such as Trezeguet, Henry, and Patrick Vieira were given a chance to display their talent, gaining squad places in ahead of many long-time French national veterans. They went on to win the World Cup that year, as well as the Euro 2000 competition, which was won when Trezeguet himself scored a golden goal in the final against Italy. He also played for France in the 2002 and 2006 FIFA World Cups and Euro 2004. Trezeguet was named one of the 125 greatest living footballers in 2004.

On 9 July 2006, Trezeguet took part in the final of the 2006 FIFA World Cup. The match, against Italy, went to penalty kicks after a 1-1 tie and Trezeguet was the sole player from either team to miss a penalty kick, hitting the crossbar, as Italy won 5-3.

On 19 October 2007, Trezeguet threatened to quit France after being overlooked for two Euro 2008 qualifying matches by French manager Raymond Domenech. Trezeguet was selected to the French team in March 2008 for a friendly against England to replace the injured Karim Benzema, but then was not chosen for the French team that competed in Euro 2008.

On 9 July 2008, Trezeguet announced his retirement from international football. He cited "the awful Euro and the reappointment of the coach" being the main reasons for this decision. He also added "I see football differently from how they see it in France. The Euro was very negative, but what annoys me more is that Domenech is staying."

<p>Patrick Vieira</p>

PROFILE:
Full name : Patrick Vieira
Date of birth : 23 June 1976 
Place of birth : Dakar, Senegal
Height : 1.92 m 
Playing position : Midfielder

Mini Bio:
Patrick Vieira (born 23 June 1976 in Dakar) is a Senegalese-born French footballer of Cape Verdean ancestry who plays as a midfielder for English Premier League club Manchester City and the French national team, of which he is the former captain.

He rose to prominence during his stint at Arsenal from 1996 to 2005, where he won three Premier League titles ñ one unbeaten ñ and four FA Cups, eventually becoming club captain. After leaving Arsenal in 2005, he spent one season at Juventus before joining Internazionale in 2006, following Juventus' relegation for their part in a match-fixing scandal. He has 107 caps for France, and was part of their 1998 World Cup and Euro 2000-winning sides.

In August 2008, Vieira was ranked the fifth greatest Arsenal player of all-time in a fan poll conducted on the club's official website.

On a less positive note, he also ranks among the players to have appeared in the English game with the worst disciplinary record, having been sent off 10 times during nine years at Arsenal.

On 11 May 2010, Patrick Vieira was nominated Goodwill Ambassador of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO).

While at Arsenal, despite being born in Senegal and ethnically being of Cape Verdean origin, Vieira chose to make his debut for France in 1997 against the Netherlands. He was part of the France squad in the 1998 FIFA World Cup. He came on as a substitute in the final against Brazil, and set up Emmanuel Petit for France's third goal in a 3ñ0 win.[26] He, with the rest of the squad, received Knight of LÈgion d'honneur, France's highest decoration, in 1998.

He subsequently played as a first choice midfield player in France's successful campaign in Euro 2000, which they won, beating Italy in the final. He helped France to victory in the 2001 FIFA Confederations Cup, ending the tournament as joint top scorer with two goals, including the winner in the final against Japan. He also played in all three games in the FIFA World Cup 2002, in which France were eliminated in the group stage, failing to score a goal. He was injured and missed France's defeat to Greece at Euro 2004.

Vieira was appointed France's national team captain on ZinÈdine Zidane's retirement from international football. Nonetheless, he and veteran defender Lilian Thuram were instrumental in convincing Zidane to end his retirement and help the flagging campaign to qualify for the 2006 FIFA World Cup. Vieira even handed back the captaincy of the team to Zidane.

On June 23, 2006, his 30th birthday, Vieira took the captain's armband for the match in place of the suspended playmaker Zidane, whom he shared the birthday with, scoring the first goal when France beat Togo 2ñ0 in the group stages of the FIFA World Cup 2006; Vieira set up Thierry Henry for France's second. This win helped France advance to the knockout stages, coming second behind Switzerland, and it prolonged Zidane's international career. In the round of sixteen, Vieira scored the second goal in France's 3ñ1 defeat of Spain; France went on to beat favourites Brazil 1ñ0 in the quarter-finals, and Portugal by the same score in the semi-finals, which gave them a place in the final against Italy. Vieira was one of the best midfielders at the tournament with a string of fine dominant performances. Having played in every match up to the final, Vieira started the match but was substituted due to injury in the second half, likely sustained when he collided with Italian defender Fabio Cannavaro. Italy won 5ñ3 on penalties after the game finished 1ñ1 after extra time. As of November 23, 2006 Vieira has appeared 100 times for France, scoring 6 goals.

On August 5, 2006 Vieira was reappointed captain of the French national team for the Euro 2008 qualifying campaign. However, he played no part in the group games at Euro 2008 for a struggling France due to a niggling knee injury. His last cap with the national team was on June 2, 2009 in a friendly match against Nigeria. He was not included by coach Raymond Domenech in France's squad for the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa.

PROFILE:
Full name : Zinedine Yazid Zidane
Date of birth : 23 June 1972 
Place of birth : Marseille, France
Height: 1.85 m 
Playing position : Attacking midfielder

Mini Bio:
Zinedine Yazid Zidane is a retired French World Cup-winning footballer. Widely regarded as one of the game's all-time greats, Zidane played for club teams in France, Italy and Spain, and was a member of the French national team. His career accomplishments include helping France win the 1998 World Cup and Euro 2000, in addition to winning the 2002 UEFA Champions League with Real Madrid. One of only two three-time FIFA World Player of the Year winners, the other being Ronaldo, Zidane also won the Ballon d'Or in 1998. He retired from professional football after the 2006 World Cup.

Both France and Algeria consider Zidane a citizen, but he was ineligible to play for the Algerian national team. There was a rumour that coach Abdelhamid Kermali denied Zidane a position for the Algerian squad because he felt the young midfielder was not fast enough. However, Zidane dismissed the rumor in a 2005 interview, saying that he would have been ineligible to play for Algeria because he had already played for France.

He earned his first cap with France as a substitute in a friendly against the Czech Republic on 17 August 1994, which ended in a 2-2 draw after Zidane scored twice to help France erase a 2-0 deficit. After …ric Cantona was handed a year-long suspension in January 1995 for assaulting a fan, Zidane took over the playmaker position. France were eliminated in the Euro 96 semi-finals in a penalty shootout by the Czech Republic after the match ended 0-0 in extra time.

The 1998 FIFA World Cup was the first World Cup that Zidane participated in. It was held in his home country France. The French team won all three games in the group stage but Zidane was sent off in the second match against Saudi Arabia for a stamp on Fuad Anwar, becoming the first French player to receive a red card in a World Cup finals. Without their suspended playmaker France proceeded to win 1-0 in the last sixteen game against Paraguay and, on his return to the side, defeated Italy on penalties after a goalless draw in the quarter finals. They defeated Croatia 2-1 in the semi-final. Zidane played a major role in the team's accomplishment, though he had yet to open his goal tally on the world stage.

Zidane and France went on to play against defending champions and favourites Brazil at the Stade de France in the final of the World Cup. France dominated from the start, with Zidane scoring two goals, both headers from corner kicks. Emmanuel Petit added a late third goal to seal the win and France's first ever world title. Zidane became an instant national hero and his image was projected onto the Arc de Triomphe.

Two years later France won Euro 2000, becoming the first team to hold both the World Cup and the European Championship since West Germany in 1974. Zidane finished with two goals, a memorable free kick against Spain in the quarter final and the golden goal in the semi final with Portugal, and was named player of the tournament by UEFA.

As reigning world and European champions, France entered the 2002 World Cup as favourites but a thigh injury prevented Zidane from playing in France's first two matches and without their talisman the French team had failed to score in either match. He was rushed back prematurely for the third game despite not being fully fit, but could not prevent France from being ignominiously eliminated in the group stage without scoring a single goal; the worst performance by a defending champion in the history of the competition.

France again performed below expectations at Euro 2004 were knocked out by eventual champions Greece in the quarter finals. Zidane, however, had one of the most notable games of his career in the opening match against England, scoring in the 91st and 93rd minutes to turn a 0-1 defeat into a 2-1 victory for the French. After France's elimination Zidane announced his retirement from international football.

With the mass retirement of veteran key players such as Bixente Lizarazu, Marcel Desailly, Claude MakÈlÈlÈ and Lilian Thuram, France struggled to qualify for the 2006 World Cup. However, at the urging of coach Raymond Domenech, Zidane came out of retirement and was immediately instated as team captain.He made his competitive return in a 3-0 win over the Faroe Islands on 3 September 2005, as France went on to win their qualifying group.On 27 May 2006, Zidane earned his hundredth cap for France in a 1-0 friendly win over Mexico, becoming France's fourth player ever to reach this milestone, after Desailly, Thuram and Didier Deschamps.

Zidane had a slow start to the 2006 World Cup and, after being suspended for the final match of the group stage, returned to set up a goal for Patrick Vieira and score one himself in the second round match against Spain. In the quarter final France held Brazil to just one shot on goal in the rematch of the 1998 final. Zidane assisted Thierry Henry's deciding goal and he was named Man of the Match by FIFA. France faced Portugal in the semi final and, as in Brussels six years earlier, Zidane's penalty kick decided the contest and sent France to another major final.

Before the final, Zidane was awarded the Golden Ball as the best player of the competition. Having already announced he was to retire after the expiration of his Real Madrid contract at the end of the 2005-06 season, the world of football already knew Zidane's second World Cup final was to be the last match of his career. Seven minutes into the match Zidane put France ahead with a penalty kick and became only the fourth player in World Cup history to score in two different finals, along with PelÈ, Paul Breitner, and Vav·, in addition to being tied for first place with Vav·, PelÈ and Geoff Hurst with three World Cup final goals apiece. Zidane was sent off in extra-time after headbutting Marco Materazzi following verbal taunts and insults from the Italian concerning his mother and sister, and so did not participate in the penalty shootout, in which Italy won 5ñ3. Zidane was allowed to keep the Golden Ball award.In 2010, Zidane said that he "would rather die" than apologize to Materazzi for the headbutt in the finalbut also claimed that he ìcould never have lived with himselfî had France won the match.


In 2004, Forbes magazine named him the 42nd-highest paid athlete in the world, with earnings of US$15.8 million a year.In November 2006, Zidane toured Bangladesh as the guest of Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus. He also visited the Algerian birthplace of his parents, and met personally with president Abdel Aziz Bouteflika.

Filmmakers Philippe Parreno and Douglas Gordon filmed a documentary Zidane, which follows Zidane during an entire match, filmed with 17 cameras. The documentary was part of the 2009 Full Frame Documentary Film Festival.

PROFILE:
Full name:	Michael Ballack
Date of birth: 26 September 1976 
Place of birth: Gorlitz, East Germany
Height:1.89 m 
Playing position:Midfielder

Mini Bio:
Michael Ballack (born 26 September 1976) is a German footballer, who is currently a free agent since his release from Chelsea and is the former captain of the German national football team. He is among the top goal scorers in the history of his international team. Ballack has worn the number 13 shirt for every team he has played for except for Kaiserslautern. He was selected by PelÈ as one of FIFA's 100 Greatest Living Players, and as the UEFA Club Midfielder of the Year in 2002. He has won the German Footballer of the Year award three times ñ in 2002, 2003 and 2005.

Ballack began his career as a youth at Chemnitz, his local team, and made his professional debut in 1995. Although the team were relegated in his first season, his performances in the Regionalliga the following season led to a transfer to Kaiserslautern in 1997. He won the Bundesliga in his first season at the club; his first major honour. He became a first team regular in 1998ñ99 season and also earned his first senior national cap for Germany. He moved to Bayer Leverkusen for Ä4.1 million in 1999. The 2002 season saw him win a slew of runners-up medals: Bayer Leverkusen finished second in the Bundesliga, German Cup, UEFA Champions League and Germany lost to Brazil in the 2002 World Cup Final.

A Ä12.9 million move to Bayern Munich led to further honours: the team won the Bundesliga and German Cup double in 2003, 2005 and 2006. Ballack had become a prolific goalscorer from midfield, scoring 58 goals for Bayern Munich between 2002 and 2006. He joined Premier League side Chelsea in mid-2006 and won his first English honours, the FA Cup and Football League Cup, in his first season at the club. Injury ruled out much of 2007 but he returned the following season, helping Chelsea reach their first ever Champions League Final.

Internationally, Ballack has played in the European Championships in 2000, 2004 and 2008, and the FIFA World Cup in 2002 and 2006. J¸rgen Klinsmann appointed him captain of the national team in 2004. He captained his country in the Euro 2008 Final but the team lost to Spain.

On 26 March 1996, Ballack debuted for the national U21 team against Denmark, shortly after signing for Chemnitz. In all, he played 19 matches for this side, scoring four goals. Then, following his move to Kaiserslautern, national coach Berti Vogts called him up to the senior team.

Ballack's first appearance, however, did not come until 28 April 1999, when he came on as a substitute for Dietmar Hamann in a match against Scotland.

Ballack only played 63 minutes at the UEFA Euro 2000 championship. In the 2002 FIFA World Cup, he scored in matches against the United States and South Korea during the knock-out rounds as Germany reached the final. However, he was booked for a tactical foul during the semi-final match against South Korea and was suspended for the final which Germany went on to lose 2ñ0 to Brazil. He was included in the World Cup All Star Team.

Following the UEFA Euro 2004 championship, J¸rgen Klinsmann replaced Rudi Vˆller at the helm of the national team and Ballack took over Oliver Kahn as captain.

In the 2006 FIFA World Cup, he was unable to start in Germany's first game against Costa Rica due to a calf strain, but appeared in the following five matches. Germany was eliminated in the semi-finals, but they managed to clinch 3rd place in a match against Portugal. He was named Man of the Match in the games against Ecuador and Argentina,[16] and was included in FIFA's World Cup All Star Team for a second consecutive time.

On 6 February 2008, Ballack played his first match since returning from injury in a 3ñ0 friendly win over Austria.

Ballack started and captained Germany's first game of the UEFA Euro 2008 championship against Poland. He proved to be an influential figure in the midfield as Germany came back from a shock defeat to Croatia to make it to the final, scoring a free kick against Austria to secure Germany a 1ñ0 win and a place in the quarter-finals. In the quarter-finals, he scored a controversial header against Portugal to make the score 3ñ1 in their 3ñ2 win after an assist by Bastian Schweinsteiger's 60th minute free kick, helping Germany to advance to the semi-finals. Germany went on to beat Turkey 3ñ2 in the semifinals. Prior to the final, Ballack sustained a calf injury but eventually overcame it in time. However, Germany ended up losing 1ñ0 to Spain. Nevertheless, he was named in the Team of the Tournament.

Ballack can boast that, dating back to June 2005, Germany has never lost a game when he has scored. He scored 4 goals in the 2010 World Cup qualifiers. However, it was announced on 17 May 2010 that Ballack would not be playing in the 2010 FIFA World Cup following a foul by Kevin Prince-Boateng - who plays for the Ghana national team - resulting in an ankle injury sustained two days earlier in the FA Cup Final.

<p>Franz Beckenbauer</p>
<i>
PROFILE:
Full name : Franz Anton Beckenbauer
Date of birth : 11 September 1945
Place of birth : Munich, Germany
Height : 1.82 m 
Playing position : Sweeper

Mini Bio:
Franz Anton Beckenbauer (born 11 September 1945) is a German football coach, manager, and former player, nicknamed Der Kaiser ("The Emperor") because of his elegant style, his leadership, his first name "Franz" (reminiscent of the Austrian emperors), and his dominance on the football pitch. He is generally regarded as the greatest German footballer of all time and one of the greatest and most decorated footballers in the history of the game.

Beckenbauer was a versatile player who started out as a midfielder but made his name as a defender. He is often credited as having invented the role of the modern sweeper or libero.

Twice selected the European Footballer of the Year, he appeared 103 times for West Germany and played in three World Cups. He lifted the World Cup trophy as captain in 1974, and repeated the feat as a manager in 1990. With the club Bayern Munich, he won three consecutive European Cups from 1974 to 1976, and the Cup Winners' Cup in 1967. Beckenbauer is the only player to captain three European Cup winning sides. He went on to become coach and president of the institution. He is also a member of the National Soccer Hall of Fame.

In 1999, he was voted second place, behind Johan Cruyff, in the European player of the Century election held by the IFFHS and he was voted third, behind PelÈ and Cruyff, in the IFFHS' "World Player of the Century" election.

Today, Beckenbauer remains an influential figure in both German and international football. He led Germany's successful bid to host the 2006 FIFA World Cup and chaired the organizing committee. He also works as a pundit for German television network Sat.1 during their coverage of the UEFA Champions League and writes a football column for mass tabloid Bild.

In 1966 World Cup,Beckenbauer appeared in his first World Cup in 1966, playing every match. In his first World Cup match, against Switzerland, he scored twice in a 5ñ0 win. West Germany won their group, and then beat Uruguay 4ñ0 in quarter-finals, with Beckenbauer scoring the second goal in the 70th minute. In the semi-finals, the Germans faced the USSR. Helmut Haller opened the scoring, with Beckenbauer contributing the second of the match, his fourth goal of the tournament. The Soviets scored a late goal but were unable to draw level, and West Germany advanced to the final against hosts England. The English won the final and the Jules Rimet Trophy in extra time, aided by a controversial goal. The Germans had fallen at the final hurdle, but Beckenbauer had had a notable tournament, finishing tied for third on the list of top scorersófrom a non-attacking position. The team returned to a heroes' welcome in their homeland.

In 1970 World Cup,West Germany won their first three matches before facing England in second round on a rematch of the 1966 final. The English were ahead 2ñ0 in the second half, but a spectacular goal by Beckenbauer in the 69th minute helped the Germans recover and equalise before the end of normal time and win the match in extra time. West Germany advanced to the semi-finals to face Italy, in what would be known as the Game of the Century. He fractured his clavicle after being fouled, but he was not deterred from continuing in the match, as his side had already used their two permitted substitutions. He stayed on the field carrying his dislocated arm in a sling. The result of this match was 4ñ3 (after extra time) in favour of the Italians. Germany defeated Uruguay 1ñ0 for third place.

In 1974 World Cup,The 1974 World Cup was hosted by West Germany and Beckenbauer led his side to victory, including a hardfought 2ñ1 win over the hotly favoured Netherlands side featuring Johan Cruyff. Beckenbauer and fellow defenders man-marked Cruyff so well that the Dutch were never quite able to put their "Total Football" into full use.

Beckenbauer became the first captain to lift the new FIFA World Cup Trophy after Brazil had retained the Jules Rimet Trophy in 1970. This also gave West Germany the distinction of being the only national team at the time to hold both the Euro and World Cup titles simultaneously; France also accomplished this feat in 2000.

In European Championships, Beckenbauer became captain of the national side in 1971. In 1972, West Germany won the European Championship, beating the Soviet Union 3ñ0 in the final. In 1976, West Germany again reached the final, where they lost on penalties to Czechoslovakia.

PROFILE:
Full name : Paul Breitner
Date of birth : 5 September 1951 
Place of birth : Kolbermoor, West Germany
Height : 1.76 m
Playing position : Defender, Midfielder

Mini Bio:
Paul Breitner (born 5 September 1951 in Kolbermoor, Bavaria) is a former German football player. One of Germany's most controversial players, he was capped 48 times for his country.

His football career lasted from 1970 until 1983, mainly playing for Bayern Munich (1970ñ74 and 1978ñ83) and Real Madrid (1974ñ78), with a short intermezzo in Eintracht Braunschweig. His early success was as a free roaming left back, as likely to score from the right midfield as to stop an attacker in his own penalty area. Later in his career he moved to midfield and became one of the top midfielders through the early 1980s.

The early peak of Breitner's long and successful career was at age 21 in 1972 as part of the winning German European Championship team. This was followed two years later with victory as a member of the German World Cup squad. The final was played in Munich against the Netherlands, and Breitner scored the first German goal on a penalty kick. In the final, he, Franz Beckenbauer and Berti Vogts formed a slick unit at the back and their water-tight defense prevented the Dutch from winning the World Cup. He moved to Real Madrid following the World Cup and quit the West German squad, remaining off the side until enticed to return by Jupp Derwall in 1981. Breitner is one of only four footballers to have achieved the feat of scoring in two different World Cup final matches, sharing that honour with PelÈ, Vav·, and ZinÈdine Zidane. He achieved this in 1974 against the Netherlands and in 1982 against Italy.

During his club career, Breitner won seven National Championships with Bayern Munich (1972, 1973, 1974, 1980, 1981) and Real Madrid (1975, 1976), the Champions' Cup (1974) as well as the German (1971, 1982) and Spanish Cups (1975). During his spell with Bayern Munich, Karl-Heinz Rummenigge and he formed such a formidable one-two-punch that they were often called Breitnigge.

By many of the older and more traditional football fans in Germany he was decried for his "revolutionary" attitude and his tendency for voicing strong opinions on political and social issues. Before the 1982 World Cup (held in Spain) former "leftist" Breitner caused a major uproar in Germany when he accepted an offer by a German cosmetics company to pay him the ñ what many Germans regarded at that time as a "scandalously high" ñ sum of 150,000 Deutsche Mark if he shaved off his fluffy full beard, used their fragrance and advertised for the company. He currently works as a football commentator in Germany and is also an advisor to the Board of Bayern Munich.

PROFILE:
Full name : Oliver Rolf Kahn
Date of birth : 15 June 1969 
Place of birth : West Germany
Height : 1.88 m 
Playing position : Goalkeeper (retired)

Mini Bio:
Oliver Rolf Kahn (born 15 June 1969) is a former German football goalkeeper. He started his career at Karlsruher SC and in 1994 was transferred to Bayern Munich, his last professional club. He is one of the most successful German players in recent history, having won eight German championships, six German cups, the UEFA Cup (1996), the UEFA Champions League and the Intercontinental Cup (both 2001). His individual contributions have earned him four consecutive UEFA Best European Goalkeeper awards, three IFFHS World's Best Goalkeeper of the Year awards, the Golden Ball at the 2002 FIFA World Cup and two German Footballer of the Year trophies. He played for the German national team (from 1994 to 2006), where he was starting goalkeeper of the 2002 World Cup squad which reached the Finals and won the FIFA World Cup Golden Ball for his performance. Kahn is nicknamed "King Kahn"or "The Titan" due to his formidable presence and influence

He made his last professional appearance for Bayern Munich on 27 May 2008 at the Salt Lake Stadium (Yuvabharati Krirangam), Kolkata in a friendly against Mohun Bagan of India during Bayern's Asian tour of 2008. Around 120,000 people turned up for the match. The match ended 0-3 in favour of Bayern and Michael Rensing substituted 'King Kahn' in the 55th minute. He is considered to be one of the greatest goalkeepers of all time and is the only goalkeeper in the history of football to win the FIFA World Cup Golden Ball (in World Cup 2002).

Kahnís international debut for Germany came in a match against Switzerland on 23 June 1995; however, it was some time before he became the teamís primary goalkeeper. Initially Kahn was the reserve keeper as Germany were victorious in Euro 96 in England. He spent the 1998 FIFA World Cup in France on the bench, and it was not until Andreas Kopke announced his retirement at the end of the tournament that Kahn was finally given his chance in the No. 1 shirt. Euro 2000 was a difficult period for then-defending champions Germany, as they made an embarrassing exit in the group stage, having scored only one goal. The team drew with Romania and suffered losses to England and Portugal. Afterwards, Kahn became captain of the national team, succeeding Oliver Bierhoff.

Kahn put in what was perhaps his worst performance of his international career against England in Munich in 2001. Germany were favored to win by many as they had beaten England in 2000 1-0 at Wembley stadium. Many in the media were touting Kahn's remarkably fast reflexes. Despite a strong start from Germany, they were routed 5-1 by a hat-trick by Michael Owen.After the match, Kahn called the defeat a "catastrophe" but still was optimistic Germany would qualify. Kahn's German team managed to make the World Cup by winning a playoff against Ukraine. Despite criticism, Kahn remained as Germany's number one for the upcoming World Cup. Kahn was also named the best goalkeeper in the world by IFFHS for the second time in his career.

Expectations for Germany were comparatively low entering the 2002 FIFA World Cup, but it was Kahnís shot-stopping prowess and leadership that carried the team to a surprise appearance in the finals, and allowed only three goals in the course of the competition, two of which were in the Final. Despite playing much of the final match with torn ligaments in his right ring finger, Kahn was still blamed by some (perhaps unfairly due to the injury) for losing the championship after allowing the first goal by Brazilian striker Ronaldo off a rebound in the 67th minute. Kahn nevertheless won the Lev Yashin Award for the best goalkeeper of the tournament, and became the first goalkeeper in history to win the Golden Ball for the best individual performance.He also became the first German goalkeeper to keep five clean sheets in a World Cup tournament. Kahn maintained his number one spot for Euro 2004, but Germany were once again eliminated in the group stage. Oliver Kahn gave up his captaincy to Michael Ballack after the tournament.

Since then, Kahn had lost his status as the first choice goalkeeper for the national team, with team manager Jurgen Klinsmann rotating the number one spot between Kahn and his longtime competitor whom he had been attempting to fend off, Jens Lehmann of Arsenal. On 7 April 2006 Klinsmann announced Lehmann was his first-choice goalkeeper for the 2006 World Cup. Kahn decided to stay on as a backup for the competition. Despite their acrimonious pre-tournament battle for Germanyís starting role, Kahn openly accepted Klinsmannís decision. Kahn and Lehmann embraced and shook hands as the former offered words of encouragement before the quarter-final penalty shootout against Argentina. In the postgame conference, Kahn publicly praised Lehmann for his two decisive penalty saves.

After Germany was eliminated in the semi-finals by Italy, Kahn was given the start for the Third Place play-offs held on 8 July 2006. Kahn was also the captain of the team in the absence of the injured Michael Ballack, and so earned his last international appearance for Germany, who defeated Portugal 3-1. Although overshadowed by Bastian Schweinsteigerís game-winning performance in the match, Kahn played to a high standard, pulling off several saves throughout the match. Kahn deflected a shot by Portuguese forward Pauleta after he beat the German defence, and he later saved Decoís shot made from just inside the box.Following the match, Oliver Kahn announced his retirement from the German National Team. Throughout his international career he earned 86 caps for Germany, including 50 as team captain. He never won a World Cup, but finished as runner-up in 2002 and third in 2006.

Kahn is the subject of the song Olli Kahn by the German pop group Die Prinzen, which was recorded during the 2002 World Cup. The song was later covered by Die Toten Hosen, another popular German band.

Place of birth: Goppingen, West Germany
Height: 1.82 m 
Playing position: Striker

Mini Bio:
Jurgen Klinsmann (born 30 July 1964 in Goppingen) is a German football manager and former football player, who played for several prominent clubs in Europe and was part of the West German team that won the 1990 FIFA World Cup and the German one that won the 1996 UEFA European Championship. He was one of West Germany's/Germany's premier strikers during the 90s.

He managed the German national team to a third-place finish in the 2006 World Cup.

On 12 July 2006, Klinsmann officially announced that he would step down as Germany's coach after two years in charge and be replaced by assistant coach Joachim Low. He took over as coach of Bayern Munich in July 2008, when Ottmar Hitzfeld stepped down to take over as the head coach of the Swiss National Team. He was fired from this position on 27 April 2009 despite winning five of his last seven matches.

Klinsmann had a fruitful international career, seeing his first West Germany duty in 1987 and ultimately collecting 108 caps, a tally second only to that of Lothar Matth‰us. Klinsmann scored 47 goals for West Germany/Germany in top-level international matches, sharing the all-time third place with Rudi Vˆller, and only surpassed by Gerd M¸ller's record of 68 goals for the national team and by Miroslav Klose's 48 goals.

He participated in the 1988 Summer Olympics, winning a bronze medal; the 1988, 1992 and 1996 European Championships, reaching the final in 1992 and becoming champion in 1996. Klinsmann was the first player ever to score in three different UEFA European Championships. He did it at the 1988, 1992, and 1996 tournaments. Three other players ñ Vladimir Smicer, Thierry Henry, and Nuno Gomes ñ have equalled this record since.

He was also an important part of the West German team at the World Cup finals of 1990 (in which he scored three goals), 1994 (five goals), and 1998 (three goals), winning the World Cup in 1990. He was the first player ever to score at least three goals in each of three World Cups, later joined by Ronaldo of Brazil. He still remains second all-time in World Cup goals scored by a German with 11.

In the 2006 World Cup, the performances of Klinsmann's team silenced his critics. The team recorded three straight wins against Costa Rica, Poland and Ecuador in the first round, earning Germany first place in Group A. The first game of the knock out stage was a 2-0 victory over Sweden, and in the quarter-finals, Klinsmann's team defeated Argentina, winning 4-2 on penalties. The teams drew 1-1 after 120 minutes after an equalising goal from Miroslav Klose in the 80th minute.

In the semi-final on 4 July, Germany lost a close match with Italy 2-0 after goals in the final minutes of extra time from Fabio Grosso and Alessandro Del Piero.After the match, Klinsmann praised the performance of his young team. They beat Portugal 3-1 in the third place play-off, where he played Kahn instead of Jens Lehmann.The victory triggered a massive Berlin parade the following day where Klinsmann and the team were honoured by the public.

Afterward, Franz Beckenbauer, previously a strident critic of Klinsmann's, declared his desire to see Klinsmann continue as coach. There was also widespread public support for Klinsmann due to his team's spirit and attacking style of play. The team's strong performance is thought by some to have renewed national pride and restored Germany's reputation as a top footballing nation. Due to his success coaching the national team, Klinsmann was awarded the Bundesverdienstkreuz. He was even referred to as "Kaiser", a term meaning "emperor" in German, usually reserved for German footballing greats, e.g. Franz Beckenbauer.

Upon retiring from active play, Klinsmann started his commercial career. He became the vice-president of a sports marketing consultancy based in the United States and was involved in Major League Soccer as part of the Los Angeles Galaxy team.

Playing position : Goalkeeper

Mini Bio:
Josef Dieter "Sepp" Maier (born 28 February 1944) is a German former professional football goalkeeper. His nickname was "Die Katze von Anzing" ("the cat from Anzing") due to his incredible reflexes.

Born in Metten, Bavaria, Maier has spent his entire professional career at Bayern Munich. He began playing for Bayern's youth sides in 1958.During the 1970s, he was part of the legendary Bayern team which included the likes of Franz Beckenbauer and Gerd M¸ller and won three European Cups in a row, a German record. Between 1966 and 1979 he played in 442 consecutive Bundesliga matches, still a German national record. His playing career came to an abrupt end in 1979 when he sustained serious injuries in a car accident (caused by DWI).

Maier was selected in the West Germany squad for four consecutive World Cups. In 1966 in England, he was a non-playing deputy to Hans Tilkowski. At the 1970 FIFA World Cup in Mexico, he was the undisputed starter and played all games (including the legendary 3ñ4 semifinal loss to Italy after extra time) except the third-place match.

In the 1974 FIFA World Cup on home soil, at the top of his footballing abilities, he reached the peak of his international career as the Germans went all the way to the final with a legendary team that included the likes of Franz Beckenbauer, Berti Vogts and Gerd M¸ller. The greatest triumph came when the hosts defeated a Johan Cruyff-inspired Netherlands team 2ñ1 in the final in Maier's own hometown Munich.

Four years later at the World Cup in Argentina, slightly past his peak but still formidable, Maier delivered a strong performance but could not prevent his side's failing to advance past the second round. Maier also won the 1972 European Championship with West Germany and reached the final in 1976, losing to Czechoslovakia on penalty kicks. In all, he earned 95 caps for his country.

Maier went into coaching for both club and country and mentored Oliver Kahn. In October 2004 his contract with the national side was terminated by manager J¸rgen Klinsmann after Maier spoke out in favour of Kahn over Arsenal's Jens Lehmann in a dispute over who should be the side's first-choice goalkeeper.He continued to work as head goalkeeping coach for Bayern and retired in 2008.

In June 2009, Maier was honoured by the Bavarian government with the Life Achievement Award.

Mini Bio:
Lothar Herbert  Matthaus is a German former football player and now manager, last managing Israeli club Maccabi Netanya.

In 1990, he was named European Footballer of the Year and World Soccer Player of the Year after captaining West Germany to victory in the 1990 World Cup. One year later, he was also named the first ever FIFA World Player of the Year.

He has played in five World Cups (1982, 1986, 1990, 1994, 1998) more than any other outfield player, and holds the record for the most World Cup matches played (25 games). He also won Euro 80, and played in Euro 84, Euro 88, and Euro 2000. In 1999, he was again voted German Footballer of the Year. He is the most capped German player of all time, retiring with a total of 150 appearances (83 of them when the team was called West Germany) and 23 goals for the German national team. Matth‰us is a member of the FIFA 100 ñ a list of 125 of the greatest living football players chosen by Pele. Maradona said about Matth‰us "he is the best rival I've ever had. I guess that's enough to define him" in his book Yo soy el Diego (I am the Diego).

During his career, he usually played as an Attacking Midfielder or Defensive Midfielder, although later in his career he played as a Sweeper. He was renowned for his perceptive passing, positional sense, and well-timed tackling, as well as his explosive shot.

After ending his illustrious playing days, Matth‰us started a coaching career, which has so far been much less distinguished. In his print interviews and other media appearances he has been clear about his goal and desire to coach in the Bundesliga. His hope was that taking coaching jobs abroad would lead to offers from Germany.

Full name : Gerhard M¸ller

Place of birth : Nordlingen, Germany
Height : 1.76 m
Playing position : Striker

Mini Bio:
Gerhard "Gerd" Muller is a former (West) German football player and one of the most prolific goalscorers of all time.

With national records of 68 goals in 62 international appearances, 365 goals in 427 Bundesliga games and the international record of 66 goals in 74 European Club games, he was one of the most successful goalscorers of his era. M¸ller is now 8th on the list of all time international goalscorers despite playing fewer matches than every player in the top 15. His nicknames are ìBomber der Nationî (the nation's Bomber) and ìkleines dickes M¸llerî (Small fat M¸ller, declension intentionally wrong).

In 1970 Muller was elected European Footballer of the Year after a successful season at Bayern Munich and scoring 10 goals at the 1970 FIFA World Cup. Before the goal scored by Ronaldo against Ghana in the Round of 16 of the 2006 FIFA World Cup, M¸ller held the all-time goal-scoring record in the tournament, with a 14-goal total.

His club strike rate with Bayern Munich has been bettered by only three players: PelÈ of Santos FC, Eusebio Silva of SL Benfica as well as Ferenc Pusk·s of Budapest Honved, while his strike rate at international level for West Germany is only bettered by Just Fontaine of France.

he began his football career at the TSV 1861 Nˆrdlingen. M¸ller joined FC Bayern Munich in 1964 where he teamed up with future stars Franz Beckenbauer and Sepp Maier. The club, which would go on to become the most successful German club in history was then still in the Regionalliga S¸d (Regional League South), which was one level below the Bundesliga at the time. After one season, Bayern Munich advanced to the Bundesliga and started a long string of successes. With his club, M¸ller amassed titles during the 60s and 70s: He won the German Championship four times, the German Cup four times, the European Champions' Cup three times, the Intercontinental Cup once, and the European Cup Winnersí Cup once. A supremely opportunistic goal-scorer, he also became German top scorer seven times and European top scorer twice. M¸ller scored 365 goals in 427 Bundesliga matches for Bayern Munich, almost 100 goals more than the second most successful Bundesliga scorer, Klaus Fischer. He holds the single-season Bundesliga record with 40 goals in season 1971ñ72. He scored 68 goals in 62 German Cup games. His 66 goals in his 74 appearances at European cups are still a record.

Muller scored 68 goals in 62 games for West Germany. His international career started in 1966 and ended on 7 July 1974 with the win of the World Cup at his home stadium in Munich. He scored the winning goal for the 2-1 victory over the Netherlands in the final. His four goals in that tournament and his ten goals at the 1970 FIFA World Cup combined made him the all-time highest FIFA World Cup goalscorer overall at the time with 14 goals; his record stood until the 2006 tournament, coincidentally held in Germany, when it was broken by Brazilian forward Ronaldo on 27 June 2006 playing against Ghana; As of the end of the 2006 tournament, Ronaldo has scored 15 goals in four World Cups. Muller also participated in the 1972 European Championship, becoming top scorer with four goals (including two in the final) and winning the Championship with the German team.

PROFILE:
Date of birth : 25 September 1955 
Place of birth : Lippstadt, West Germany
Height :1.82 m 
Playing position :Forward

Mini Bio:
Karl-Heinz "Kalle" Rummenigge (born 25 September 1955 in Lippstadt) is a German former football player.

He had his greatest career success with German club Bayern Munich, where he won the Intercontinental Cup, the European Cup, as well as two league titles and two domestic cups.

A member of the German national team, Rummenigge won the 1980 European Championship and was part of the squad that finished runner-up in the 1982 FIFA World Cup and at the 1986 World Cup. He was also honoured twice as European Footballer of the Year.

He is currently the Chief Executive Officer of the FC Bayern M¸nchen AG, a daughter company of Bundesliga team Bayern Munich, as well as being the acting chairman of the European Club Association.

He joined Bayern Munich in 1974, coming from the Westphalian amateur side Borussia Lippstadt, for a transfer fee of ca. Ä 10,000. He immediately showed great strength as a dribbler. His striking qualities were initially insignificant, but would find great improvement in later years, particularly after the arrival of coach Pal Csernai in 1979. In 1979ñ80 he scored 26 goals and became for the first time the Bundesliga's top striker, a feat he could repeat in 1981 and 1984 with 29 and 26 goals, respectively.

With Bayern he won in 1975 and 1976 the European Cup of Champions. In 1975 he did not take part in the final of the competition, whilst in the year thereafter a glass of brandy sufficiently prepared the nervous Rummenigge to contribute to the defeat of AS Saint-Etienne. In the same year he became also part of the team that prevailed in the Intercontinental Cup finals against Cruzeiro EC from Belo Horizonte.

In the era of coach Csernai he found in midfielder Paul Breitner a congenial partner and he formed such a formidable one-two-punch that they were only called Breitnigge (name invented by German newspaper Bild).

The club, then often dubbed as ìFC Breitniggeî, won in this period the German championships of 1980 and 1981, and the German Cup in 1982 and 1984. A renewed triumph in the European Champions Cup was denied, when the club lost the 1982 final narrowly against Aston Villa. In the season before Rummenigge was top-scorer in this competition with 6 goals.

His substantial contribution to the successes of the club and the German national football team found also expression in personal honours. In 1980 he was named German Footballer of the Year and in '80-81 the European Footballer of the Year.

In 1984, aged 29, he was sold for a record fee of Ä 5.7m to Internazionale. Despite a notable beginning, in which he helped the team to compete until the end for the 1984ñ1985 scudetto, Rumenigge's career in Italy was mostly marred by injury problems. At the end of his contract in 1987 Rummenigge moved on to Swiss first division club Servette FC in Geneva, where he saw his career out. In his last season, 1988ñ89 he had his last success, becoming top scorer in the Swiss league with 24 goals.

With the German national football team he took part in the 1978 FIFA World Cup, 1982 FIFA World Cup and 1986 FIFA World Cup. In 1978 Germany exited in the first knock-out stage of the tournament. In 1982 and 1986 the team was runner-up behind Italy and Argentina.

Rummenigge also took part in two European Championship tournaments. In the 1980 competition in Italy Germany defeated Belgium in the final by 2-1 and won the trophy. The 1984 tournament is engraved as one of the most unsuccessful undertakings of the German national team. Germany was already ousted in the group stage.

Altogether, between 1976 and 1986, Rummenigge amassed 95 caps and scored 45 goals for the German national team, including one in the 1986 FIFA World Cup Final.

List of few Honours:
He is the 11th most capped player for Germany (inclusive of three East German Players)
He is the 5th most successful striker for Germany (inclusive one East German player)
He is the tenth most prolific scorer of all time in Bundesliga history
With Bayern Munich he is the second most prolific scorer of all time in league history after Gerd M¸ller.

PROFILE:
Full name : Uwe Seeler
Date of birth : November 5, 1936 
Place of birth : Hamburg, Germany
Playing position : Striker

Mini Bio:
Uwe Seeler (born 5 November 1936 in Hamburg) is a former German football official and retired football player. He played for Hamburger SV and also made 72 appearances for the West German national team.

Seeler followed in his father's footsteps as a player for Hamburger SV, making his first team debut in 1954 in a German Cup match, aged just under 18, scoring four goals (8ñ2 vs. Holstein Kiel). In later years, despite tempting offers from Italian and Spanish clubs he remained loyal to Hamburg, working on a second career as a merchant besides playing football, as in those days football stars in Germany did not earn the huge salaries seen now.

Seeler was a gifted striker who, among other things, was renowned for his overhead kick. He scored 137 times in 239 Bundesliga games, 43 times in 72 international games for the German national team, and 21 times in 29 European club tournament games. He was captain of both his club team and the national team for many years. He and his club won the German championship in 1960 and the DFB-Pokal (German FA Cup) in 1963. He was top scorer of the first Bundesliga season 1963ñ64 and German Footballer of the Year in 1960, 1964 and 1970.

In 1978 he and his former team-mate Franz-Josef Hˆnig played for Cork Celtic F.C. in a one-off sponsored event. Seeler had ended his active playing career in 1972. However, this match turned out to be an official League of Ireland one and Uwe scored twice. Thus, his overall record of goals scored in League and Cup matches adds up to 509 (HSV 507, Cork Celtic 2). So far, this record has never been topped by a German player.

He participated in the same four Football World Cups as PelÈ did: 1958, 1962, 1966, and 1970. Of those West German World Cup teams only the 1966 side reached the final where they lost to host nation England in extra time.

Although Seeler never won a World Cup (his involvement as a player in the tournament started 4 years after West Germany won their first World Cup (1954) and ended 4 years before they won their second (1974)), he had a prolific career in the tournament; he was the first player ever to appear in 20 World Cup matches (he retired with 21 matches played, tied for third all-time); the first ever to score in 4 world cups (beating Pele by only a few minutes), and the only player ever to score at least 2 goals in each of 4 world cups. He also ranks third in all-time minutes played in World Cups, with 1980, behind Paolo Maldini and Lothar Matthaus.

Uwe Seeler was a tremendously popular player due to his fairness, modesty, and kindness and is still widely called Uns Uwe (northern German: Our Uwe) in Hamburg and the surrounding area. The DFB (German FA) made him the second honorary captain of the German national team in 1972 (the first being Fritz Walter). In 2003 he became honorary citizen of his hometown Hamburg, the first time the honor was bestowed on a sportman.

Playing position : Striker

Mini Bio:
Emilio ButragueÒo Santos (born 22 July 1963 in Madrid) is a former Spanish football striker, best known for his spell with Real Madrid.

Nicknamed El Buitre (The Vulture), the skilled player was a member of the legendary Quinta del Buitre, along with Manolo SanchÌs, Rafael MartÌn V·zquez, MÌchel and Miguel Pardeza.

In 1981, ButragueÒo joined Real Madrid's youth system, and played first for its reserve side, before being given his senior debut by Alfredo di StÈfano on 5 February 1984 against Cadiz CF. He made an instant impact, scoring twice and assisting for the third goal in a 3ñ2 away turnaround, as Real had trailed by 0ñ2. On 12 December that year, he made his European competition debut, contributing to a 6ñ1 home triumph against R.S.C. Anderlecht (after a 0ñ3 loss in Brussels).

At the time, Real Madrid's form was so patchy that first team's attendances were poorer than the reserve side ones.ButragueÒo contributed to the side's transformation, and was a prominent member of the team during the 1980s, winning numerous honours: he received the European Bronze award for best footballer in two consecutive years, and won the Pichichi in 1991, while also being instrumental in the capital club's five national leagues, two domestic cups and two (consecutive) UEFA Cups.

In June 1995, having lost his influence in the Real Madrid side (only eight matches, with one goal, as the club won another league), mainly due to the emergence of 17-year old Ra˙l Gonzalez, ButragueÒo signed for Club Celaya in Mexico and, in his first year, the team reached the final of the championship. After three years, where he was known as the Gentleman of the Pitch (never received a single red card during his entire career), he finally decided to retire from the game in April 1998

Butragueno played 69 international matches for Spain, and scored 26 goals. His debut came on 17 October 1984, against Wales in a 1986 World Cup qualifier, although he had already been picked as an uncapped player for the UEFA Euro 1984 team, as the nation finished runners-up.

Butragueno was also selected for the 1986 FIFA World Cup, where he played a major part, scoring four goals as Spain beat Denmark 5ñ1 in the round of 16 match. He also played in Italia '90, and was the national side's fifth-highest all-time top scorer with 26 goals, behind Raul (44), David Villa (31), Fernando Hierro (29) and Fernando Morientes (27).

Still as a player, Butragueno had a computer game with his name released, in 1988.

In October 2004, he replaced Jorge Valdano, a former teammate, as Real Madrid's Director of football and, until the end of 2005ñ06, also served as the club's vice-president.

Mini Bio:
Luis Enrique MartÌnez GarcÌa (born May 8, 1970 in GijÛn, Asturias), known as Luis Enrique, is a former Spanish footballer. His usual position was right or attacking midfielder, but he was notable for his versatility, having played in all positions throughout his career except central defender and goalkeeper.

He was a prolific goalscorer, for both club and country, and was also noted for his temperament and stamina. Starting in 1991 and ending in 2004, he represented both Real Madrid and FC Barcelona, with equal individual and team success.

After starting his career with Sporting de GijÛn, Luis Enrique spent most of it with the two biggest Spanish clubs: first Real Madrid for five seasons and, in a stunning move, he saw out his contract and moved to fierce rivals FC Barcelona on a free transfer. The Catalan club's supporters were at first understandably hesitant about their new acquisition, but he soon won the culÈs heart, staying eight years with the club, eventually becoming first-team captain, and scoring several times in El Cl·sico against his former employers.

In his first three seasons with Barcelona, Enrique netted 46 league goals, with BarÁa finishing runner-up in 1996ñ97, subsequently winning back-to-back domestic accolades.

On August 10, 2004, at the age of 34, he announced his retirement, feeling that he could no longer keep up to the standards he set for himself. Enrique finished his professional career with 400 games and 102 goals, being named by PelÈ as one of the top 125 greatest living footballers in March.

In June 18, 2008, Luis Enrique returned to Barcelona, taking over the reins of FC Barcelona B, which was renamed Barcelona AtlËtic for 2008ñ09. As he succeeded longtime BarÁa teammate Josep Guardiola, he stated: "I have come home", and "I finished playing here and now I will start coaching here."

Enrique played for Spain in three FIFA World Cups: 1994, 1998 and 2002 (as well as UEFA Euro 1996), and accumulated 62 caps, scoring 12 goals in his international career. He was also a member of the gold-winning squad at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona.

He the 1994 World Cup, held in the United States. In the 2ñ1 quarterfinal loss against Italy, Mauro Tassotti's elbow made contact with Enrique's face to bloody effect.The action was of such impact that Enrique reportedly lost a pint of blood from his face as a result. During the match the incident went unpunished. Tassotti was banned for eight games afterwards, and never played for Italy again.

When Spain met Italy at Euro 2008 on June 22, to battle for a place in the semifinals, Enrique reportedly called for the team to "take revenge" on Italy for the 1994 World Cup incident.Tassotti, now an assistant coach at his beloved A.C. Milan, told Marca newspaper that he was tired of always being reminded of this incident and that he had never intended to hurt Enrique.

PROFILE:
Full name : Raul Gonzalez Blanco
Date of birth : 27 June 1977 
Place of birth : Madrid, Spain
Height : 1.82 m 
Playing position : Striker/Attacking Midfielder

Mini Bio:
Raul Gonzalez Blanco (born 27 June 1977 in Madrid, Spain), known simply as Raul, is a Spanish footballer who plays as a striker. He has played for Spanish club Real Madrid his entire career and is the club's all-time top goalscorer. Ra˙l is a three-time winner of the UEFA Champions League and has long been the competition's all-time leading goal scorer. He is also the all-time top goalscorer for the Spanish national side, although he has not played for the team since 2006.

Although he started out with cross-town rivals AtlÈtico Madrid, he began the 1994-95 season in Madrid's C-team, but was promoted to first team status by coach Jorge Valdano after impressing with sixteen goals in nine games. He became the youngest player (seventeen years and four months) ever to play for the senior side, scoring in his second senior game against derby rivals Atletico Madrid. In all, Ra˙l registered nine goals in 28 appearances to help Real Madrid win the 1994-95 league championship in his first season. Over the next eight seasons, he won several honours, including another three La Liga titles and three Champions Leagues. For most of this time, Ra˙l struck up a prolific scoring partnership with Fernando Morientes (and later, Ronaldo). Ra˙l took over the captaincy of Real Madrid when Fernando Hierro was transferred in 2003, a responsibility he holds to this day. Unusually for such a successful and long-serving player, and despite appearing in two finals, 2002 (in which he scored) and 2004, Raul has never won the Copa del Rey (Spanish Cup).
 


He became the first player to score fifty Champions League goals when he netted in a 2-1 group stage win over Olympiacos on 28 September 2005, and continues to be the all-time leader in both Champions League goals (66) and appearances (128). He was also the first player to score in two Champions League finals, netting in the finals of both 2000 vs. Valencia in Paris, and 2002 vs. Bayer Leverkusen in Glasgow. Samuel Eto'o later accomplished this feat, scoring in the 2006 final against Arsenal and in 2009 against Manchester United.

Raul began his rise in the international scene with the youth teams and was chosen to represent Spain at the 1995 FIFA World Youth Championship, scoring 2 goals. He has scored a national record 44 goals in 102 caps for Spain. He is also second in terms of caps won for Spain, with 102. The former captain has made more international appearances for Spain than any other outfield player. Ra˙l was not chosen for Euro 1996 and had to wait until October 1996 to earn his first senior cap against the Czech Republic. He participated in three World Cups from 1998 to 2006, along with Euro 2000 and Euro 2004, scoring at least one goal in each of the three World Cup competitions. Ra˙l took over the team captaincy following the retirement of Fernando Hierro in 2002, but has not been chosen for the national team since September 2006, following a shock 3-2 defeat against Northern Ireland in Belfast (a game in which Ra˙l hit the post late on). In addition, he was not selected for the UEFA Euro 2008 final tournament (which Spain eventually won) as Luis AragonÈs preferred Fernando Torres and David Villa. His clubmate and goalkeeper Iker Casillas succeeded him as captain.

Of his 44 international goals, Ra˙l scored 25 goals in competitive games, 6 of which were in the finals of major tournaments. In a Euro 2000 qualifier, on 27 March 1999, Ra˙l scored one of only two international hat-tricks during Spain's 9-0 rout of Austria. Interestingly, another international hat-trick was scored 4 days later, against San Marino during the same qualifying tournament.

PROFILE:
Full name : Eusebio da Silva Ferreira
Date of birth : 25 January 1942 
Place of birth : Lourenco Marques, Portuguese East Africa (now Mozambique)
Height : 1.77 m
Playing position : Forward

Mini Bio:
Eusebio da Silva Ferreira, GCIH, GCM , commonly known simply as Eusebio, is a retired Portuguese football forward of Mozambican origin. He is considered one of the best footballers of all-time,by the IFFHS.He helped the Portuguese national team reach third place at the 1966 World Cup, being the top goalscorer of the tournament with nine goals (six of which were scored at Goodison Park) and was elected the European Footballer of the Year in 1965. He played for Benfica for 15 years, and is the team's all-time top scorer.

Nicknamed "The Black Panther", or "The Black Pearl", EusÈbio scored for Benfica 727 goals in 715 games. He is also known for his speed and his powerful, accurate right-footed strike. He is considered Benfica's and Portugal's most renowned player and the first world-class African striker. He was elected the 10th best footballer of the 20th century in a poll by the IFFHS. Pele named EusÈbio as one of the 125 best living footballers in his 2004 FIFA 100 list. In November 2003, to celebrate UEFA's Jubilee, he was selected as the Golden Player of Portugal by the Portuguese Football Federation as their most outstanding player of the past 50 years.

In 1962, he won the European Cup with Benfica, scoring two goals in the final against Real Madrid. Benfica won 5ñ3. Benfica were also European Cup runners-up in 1963, 1965, and 1968.

He was the 1965 European Footballer of the Year and in 1968 was the first winner of the Golden Boot Award, as Europe's leading scorer, a feat he repeated five years later. The Portuguese First Division's top scorer seven times from 1964 to 1973, he helped Benfica to 11 league championships (1961, 1963ñ65, 1967ñ69, 1971ñ73, 1975) and five cup wins (1962, 1964, 1969, 1970, 1972). He scored 727 goals in 715 matches wearing Benfica's jersey, including 317 goals in 301 Portuguese league matches.

In 1976ñ77 and 1977ñ78, EusÈbio played for two minor Portuguese teams, Beira-Mar, in I Division, and Uniao de Tomar, in the II Division.

He also played in the North American Soccer League (NASL), for three different teams, from 1975 to 1977: Boston Minutemen (1975), Toronto Metros-Croatia (1976), and the Las Vegas Quicksilver (1977). His most successful season in the NASL was in 1976 with Toronto Metros-Croatia. He scored in their 3ñ0 victory at the 76 Soccer Bowl to win the NASL title. The same year, he played ten games for Monterrey in the Mexican league.

The following season (1977), he signed for the Las Vegas Quicksilver. This was to be a very disappointing end to Eusebio's career. By this time, injuries had taken their toll on The Black Panther, and he was constantly receiving medical treatment whilst playing for the Quicksilver. During the season he only managed to score two goals.

Although his knees robbed him of his ability to continue in the NASL, EusÈbio wanted to continue to play soccer. He found a home in 1978 with the New Jersey Americans of the second-tier American Soccer League (ASL). He was forced to retire for good at the end of the season.

Eusebio was the all-time leading scorer for his country, with 41 goals (in 64 matches), until Pauleta surpassed his record against Latvia on 12 October 2005. He made his debut for the Portuguese national team against Luxembourg on 19 October 1961, a match his country lost 4ñ2.

He was the leading scorer in the 1966 World Cup where he scored nine goals, including four against Korea DPR in quarterfinals, a match in which Portugal came back to win 5ñ3 after trailing 3ñ0.

In the semi-final match against England, EusÈbio scored Portugal's only goal on a penalty in the 82nd minute.

In addition to winning the European Golden Boot for the 1966 World Cup, EusÈbio also set a record that year for the most penalties scored (shoot-out not included) with four. Eusebio's four goals against Korea DPR in the quarter-final match also helped Portugal tie the record for largest deficit overcome in a win (three goals, equaling Austria in 1954). The English were so impressed by Eusebio's performances that he was immediately added to the Madame Tussauds collection of waxwork.

Eusebio, however, never played in another World Cup finals tournament, though he took part in the 1970 and 1974 qualifiers. His last game for the national team was a 2ñ2 draw against Bulgaria on 19 October 1973 in a World Cup qualifier.

PROFILE:
Full name: Luis Filipe Madeira Caeiro Figo
Date of birth : 4 November 1972 
Place of birth : Almada, Portugal
Height : 1.80 m 
Playing position : Attacking midfielder / Winger

Mini Bio:
Luis Filipe Madeira Caeiro Figo (born 4 November 1972) is a retired Portuguese footballer. He played as a midfielder for Sporting CP, Barcelona, Real Madrid, and Internazionale, during a career which spanned over 20 years. He retired from football on 31 May 2009. He won 127 caps for the Portuguese national football team, a number that makes him the most capped player for Portugal.

Figo was the 2000 European Footballer of the Year, the 2001 FIFA World Player of the Year, and was named amongst the FIFA 100.

Figo is one of the few footballers to have played for both the Spanish rival clubs Barcelona and Real Madrid. He had a successful career highlighted by several trophy wins, such as one Portuguese Cup, four La Liga titles, two Spanish Cups, three Spanish Super Cups, one UEFA Champions League title, one UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, two UEFA Super Cups, one UEFA-CONMEBOL Intercontinental Cup, four Serie A titles, one TIM Italian Cup and three Italian Super Cups.

The leader of Portugal's "Golden Generation," Figo won a FIFA World Youth Championship in 1991, the same year he made his senior debut against Luxembourg on 16 October 1991, in a friendly match that ended 1ñ1 when he was only 18 years old. He has performed at the highest level ever since, making appearances at Euro 1996, Euro 2000, Euro 2004 and the 2002 and 2006 World Cups. He announced his retirement from international football following the Euro 2004 final upset-defeat by Greece, having won 117 caps and scored 31 goals. However, in June 2005, he reversed his decision and returned for the 2006 World Cup qualifying wins against Slovakia and Estonia.

Figo captained the squad during the 2006 World Cup, leading the team to the semi-finals, where they were beaten by France courtesy of a penalty from his former clubmate Zinedine Zidane. This was Portugal's best finish in 40 years. A penalty, scored by French captain Zinedine Zidane stood as the winning goal. The third place playoff caused some controversy as Figo did not start; Pauleta captained the team in his place. However, Portugal fell behind 2ñ0 to hosts Germany and Figo replaced Pauleta in the 77th minute, who handed him back the captain's armband, to cheers from both Portuguese and German fans. Although Germany scored another goal shortly after Figo's entrance, he ended his final cap for his country on a high note by setting up Nuno Gomes to head in an 88th minute consolation goal. Despite having no trophies to show for the "Golden Generation," Figo managed to captain the team to their best World Cup performance since the EusÈbio era in 1966.

After his retirement in 2009, he accepted an offer from Massimo Moratti to stay at Internazionale as a non-playing staff member, and also occasionally appeared on the bench as an assistant during the 2009ñ10 Serie A season.

Figo is a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador.

He participated in the Soccer Aid football match on 6 June 2010 for the Rest of the World team in aid of UNICEF. He also played in the 2008 match.

Mini Bio:
Rui Manuel Cesar Costa, is a former Portuguese football player and current Director of Football for Sport Lisboa e Benfica. An attacking midfielder also capable of playing as a deep-seated defensive midfielder, he most recently played for Portuguese club Benfica.

Rui Costa was a member of Portugalís most consistent years at senior level as the team reached the quarter-finals of Euro 1996, the semi-finals of Euro 2000, and the final of Euro 2004. Costa was especially instrumental in helping Portugal reach the 2004 final on home soil, scoring a screamer of a goal at his beloved Estadio da Luz against England in the quarter-final match, and the sight of a distraught Rui Costa at the end of the heartbreaking 1-0 defeat to Greece is one of the enduring images of the tournament. Costa also took part in the World Cup 2002 in Japan and South Korea scoring Portugal's winning goal in their 4-0 win over Poland. The only time in his career that Costa was sent off was in an international game against Germany.

Despite being principally a provider, Costa chipped in with a highly impressive 26 goals in 94 games.

In the summer of 1991 his displays at Fafe had impressed Portugal Under-21 coach Carlos Queiroz so much that he was called up to the team to represent Portugal in the World Youth Cup. The Portuguese under-20 national team won a World Youth Championship in 1991. His clinching penalty kick against Brasil in the final helped win the title on home soil and announced Costa as one of the brightest members of what would become known as the ìGolden Generation.î

With their success at youth level, much was expected of the Portuguese national team at senior level. However, they did not win a major international tournament at senior level.Despite not winning any major international titles, they managed to bring Portugal to their finest moments since the days of the legendary EusÈbio in the 1960s.

Full name : Marcel van Basten
Date of birth : 31 October 1964 
Place of birth : Utrecht, Netherlands
Height : 1.88 m 
Playing position : Striker

Mini Bio:
Marcel "Marco" van Basten (31 October 1964) is a Dutch football manager and former head coach of Eredivisie side AFC Ajax and the Dutch national team. Previously, he was a football player who played for Ajax and A.C. Milan in the 1980s and early 1990s. He is regarded as one of the greatest forwards of all time and scored 277 goals in a career cut short by injury. Known for his strength on the ball, his tactical awareness and spectacular strikes and volleys, van Basten was named European Footballer of the Year three times (1988, '89 and '92) and FIFA World Player of the Year in 1992. Van Basten was voted eighth in a poll organised by the French weekly magazine France Football consulting their former Ballon d'Or winners to elect the Football Player of the Century.[3] In 2004, a nationwide pool was held for the 100 greatest Dutch people (De Grootste Nederlander) and van Basten was number 25, the second highest for a football player.

Van Basten's talent was already noticed at a young age and he was called up for the 1983 FIFA World Youth Championship. He made his senior debut that same year. At the UEFA Euro 1988, van Basten scored a total of five goals, including a hat trick against England, the winning goal in the semi-final against West Germany, and a spectacular volley in the final against the Soviet Union. He was the tournament's top scorer and was the only player to score more than two goals.

The Dutch national team exited early in the World Cup in the 1990 FIFA World Cup, losing to West Germany in the second round. Van Basten never scored in the World Cup Finals.

The Netherlands reached the semi-final of UEFA Euro 1992 when they lost to Denmark in a penalty shootout, with Peter Schmeichel saving a penalty shot from van Basten.

clubs he featured include Ajax and Milan.

He played in the Demetrio Albertini testimonial at the San Siro in March 2006, and headed in a goal before being substituted early in the first half. On 22 July 2006, he also returned for the testimonial to celebrate the 11-year Arsenal career of Dennis Bergkamp, in what was the first game played at the new Emirates Stadium. He played in the second half for the Ajax legends team. He entered the match as part of a double substitution that also introduced Johan Cruyff.

In March 2007, Sky Sports ranked Marco van Basten the first on its list of the great footballers who had their careers cut short.

Van Basten officially left A.C. Milan in 1995 and retired from football, stating he would never try management. However, he changed his mind and took a course with the Royal Netherlands Football Association (KNVB). His first stint as a manager was as an assistant to his former teammate John van 't Schip with the second team of AFC Ajax in 2003ñ04. On 29 July 2004,van Basten was named the new manager of the Dutch national team, with van 't Schip as his assistant.

PROFILE:
Full name : Dennis Nicolaas Bergkamp
Date of birth : 10 May 1969 
Place of birth : Amsterdam, Netherlands
Height : 1.83 m 
Playing position : Second striker

Mini Bio:
Dennis Nicolaas Bergkamp (born 10 May 1969) is a Dutch former professional footballer. At club level he played for Ajax, Internazionale, Arsenal and also represented the Netherlands at international level. Bergkamp played most of his best games as a support striker, where his tactical awareness and deft passes made him a great exponent of the game from the 'hole'.

He was selected by Pele as one of the FIFA 125 greatest living players and is widely regarded as one of the English Premier League's all-time greatest players. In 2007 he was inducted into the English Football Hall of Fame, the first and thus far only Dutch player ever to receive the honour. He has also finished third in the FIFA World Player of the Year award twice.

Bergkamp made his international debut for the Netherlands against Italy on 26 September 1990. His first major tournament was Euro 92, where the Dutch were defending champions. Bergkamp impressed, but the Dutch lost on penalties in the semi-finals to the team that would go on to win the tournament, Denmark, despite Bergkamp scoring both in regular time and in the penalty shoot-out.

Bergkamp also impressed in the 1994 FIFA World Cup, playing in all of his side's matches, scoring a goal against Brazil, a match the Dutch ultimately lost 3-2. The Netherlands disappointed in Euro 96, with the squad riven by in-fighting, although Bergkamp still scored once, and set up Patrick Kluivert's consolatory goal against England that got the side into the quarter-finals.

Bergkamp scored three times in the 1998 FIFA World Cup, including a memorable winning goal in the final minute of the quarter-final against Argentina. Bergkamp took a leaping first touch to instantly control a long 60-yard aerial pass from Frank de Boer, brought the ball down through Argentine defender Roberto Ayala's legs, and finally finished by firing a volley with the outside of his right foot past the keeper at a tight angle from the right. With three intelligent right-footed touches in a matter of seconds, he was able to turn the game and send his national squad into the semifinal round.

The Netherlands joint-hosted Euro 2000 and were one of the favourites. After progressing through the "group of death", they lost on penalties to Italy in the semi-finals. Bergkamp didn't score at all during the tournament but still played an important role. After the defeat, Bergkamp announced his retirement from international football, because the next major tournament, the 2002 FIFA World Cup, would be played in Japan and South Korea and Bergkamp's aviophobia (see below) would prevent him from travelling there. He did not play the qualification matches, since he thought that it would be unfair to do so.

He ended his international career first on the all-time list of goal scorers for the Dutch national team, with 37 goals in 79 games, although his record has since been passed by Patrick Kluivert.

Bergkamp had the honour of being the focus of the first match at Arsenal's new ground, the Emirates Stadium. On 22 July 2006, a testimonial was played in his honour at the new stadium, with Arsenal playing his old club Ajax. Bergkamp kicked off the match with his father, Wim, and son, Mitchel. All four children acted as the match's mascots. The first half was played by members of Arsenal and Ajax's current squads, while the second was played by famous ex-players from both sides; for example Ian Wright, Patrick Vieira, Marc Overmars, Emmanuel Petit and David Seaman for Arsenal, and Marco van Basten, Danny Blind, Johan Cruijff, Frank and Ronald de Boer for Ajax. Arsenal won the match 2ñ1 with goals from Thierry Henry and Nwankwo Kanu; Klaas-Jan Huntelaar had earlier opened the scoring for Ajax, making him the first goalscorer at the Emirates Stadium.

PROFILE:
Full name : Hendrik Johannes Cruijff
Date of birth : 25 April 1947 
Place of birth :  Amsterdam, Netherlands
Height : 1.80 m 
Playing position : Attacking midfielder, Striker

Mini Bio:
Hendrik Johannes Cruijff , known as Johan Cruyff, is a retired Dutch footballer and current manager, nicknamed De Majestueuze ("The Majestic"). He won the Ballon d'Or three times in 1971, 1973 and 1974, which is a record jointly held with Michel Platini and Marco van Basten. Cruyff was the most famous exponent of the football philosophy known as Total Football explored by Rinus Michels, and is widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time.

After his retirement from playing in 1984, Cruyff became highly successful as manager of Ajax and later Barcelona; he remains an influential advisor to both clubs. His son Jordi has also gone on to play football professionally.

In 1999, Cruyff was voted European Player of the Century in an election held by the IFFHS, and came second behind Pele in their World Player of the Century poll. He came third in a vote organised by the French weekly magazine France Football consulting their former Ballon dOr winners to elect their Football Player of the Century.

On 2 November 2009, Cruyff was named as manager of the Catalonian national team in place of Pere Gratacos.This is his first coaching job in thirteen years.

As a Dutch international, Cruyff, played 48 matches, scoring 33 goals. In his second Dutch national team match, a friendly against Czechoslovakia, Cruyff was the first Dutch international to receive a red card. He received a one-year suspension from the Dutch KNVB.

Accusations of Cruyff's "aloofness" were not rebuffed by his habit of wearing a shirt with only two black stripes along the sleeves, as opposed to Adidas' usual design feature of three, worn by all the other Dutch players. Cruyff, however, had a separate sponsorship deal with Puma.

Cruyff led the Netherlands to a runners-up medal in the 1974 World Cup and was named the player of the tournament. Thanks to his team's mastery of Total Football, they coasted all the way to the final, knocking out Argentina (4ñ0), East Germany (2ñ0), and Brazil (2ñ0) along the way. Cruyff himself scored twice against Argentina in one of his team's most dominating performances, then he scored the second goal against Brazil to knock out the defending champions. The Netherlands faced hosts West Germany in the final. Cruyff kicked off and the ball was passed around the Oranje team 13 times before returning to Cruyff, who then went on a rush that eluded Berti Vogts and ended when he was fouled by Uli  inside the box. Teammate Johan Neeskens scored from the spot kick to give the Netherlands a 1ñ0 lead, and the Germans had not even touched the ball. Only during the latter half of the final was his playmaking influence stifled by the effective marking of Berti Vogts, while Franz Beckenbauer, Uli , and Wolfgang Overath dominated the midfield, enabling West Germany to win 2ñ1. Cruyff received a yellow card during half time for talking to the referee.

Cruyff retired from international football in October 1977, having helped the national team qualify for the upcoming World Cup. Without him, the Netherlands finished runners-up in the World Cup again. Initially the reason given for missing the 1978 World Cup were political reasons given a military dictatorship was in power in Argentina at that time. In 2008, however, Cruyff stated to the journalist Antoni Bassas in Catalunya R‡dio that he and his family were involved in a kidnap attempt in Barcelona a year before the tournament, and that this had caused his retirement. "To play a World Cup you have to be 200%, there are moments when there are other values in life."

On 2 November 2009, Cruyff was named as manager of the Catalonia national team in place of Pere Gratacos. It is his first managing job in thirteen years.

PROFILE:
Full name : Edgar Steven Davids
Date of birth : 13 March 1973 
Place of birth : Paramaribo, Suriname
Height : 1.70 m 
Playing position : Midfielder

Mini Bio:
Edgar Steven Davids (born 13 March 1973) is a Dutch professional footballer. After beginning his professional career with Ajax , he played for Milan, Juventus, Barcelona, Internazionale and Tottenham Hotspur before returning to the Amsterdam club. Davids has glaucoma, which required him to wear protective goggles during football matches. His dreadlocked hair and his protective eye wear made Davids one of the most recognizable footballers of his generation. Davids was one of the players chosen by PelÈ to be featured in the FIFA 100 list of the world's greatest living footballers.

Davids was an integral part of the Dutch national team since his debut in April 1994, though he has not won any major tournaments for the Oranje.

During the UEFA Euro 1996, he was sent home by then manager Guus Hiddink for saying in a radio interview: "Hiddink should stop putting his head in some players' asses."

Nonetheless, Davids remained appreciated by Hiddink, who included him in the Dutch squad for the 1998 FIFA World Cup in France. Davids' most notable performance for the national team came in the 1998 FIFA World Cup second round game against FR Yugoslavia. He scored the winning goal in the last minute of the game and ensured that the Dutch team went through to the next round to meet Argentina. The Dutch national team eventually finished 4th overall and Davids was named to the official FIFA "Team of the Tournament".

Davids played in the UEFA Euro 2000 when he was named for the UEFA "Team of the Tournament". The Netherlands reached the semi-finals and played against Italy in a thrilling game that ended up being decided with a penalty shootout.

During the Netherlands' UEFA Euro 2004 qualifying matches, Davids scored the Netherlands' first qualifying goal in their opening 3-0 victory against Belarus and subsequently bossed the midfield in five of the remaining seven Group 3 fixtures and both legs of the play-off victory against Scotland.

After Euro 2004, new national team coach Marco van Basten appointed Edgar Davids as captain of the team. However, lack of first team football at his club Inter meant Davids also lost his place in the national team in October 2004, thus losing the captain's armband in the process. At the latter stages of the qualifying series for the 2006 FIFA World Cup in October 2005, he was re-called back into the national team, though not as captain. He fell out of the picture again shortly after, thereby missing out on the Dutch squad for the 2006 World Cup.

<p>Ruud Gullit</p>

PROFILE:
Full name : Ruud Dil / Gullit
Date of birth :September 1, 1962 
Place of birth :Amsterdam, Netherlands
Height : 1.86 m 
Playing position : Defender/Midfielder/Striker

Mini Bio:
Ruud Gullit  (born as Ruud Dil, September 1, 1962 in Amsterdam) is a Dutch football manager and former football superstar, who played professionally in the 1980s and 1990s. He was the captain of the Netherlands national team that was victorious at Euro 88 and was also a member of the squad for the 1990 World Cup. He was named the European Footballer of the Year in 1987 and the World Soccer Player of the Year in 1987 and 1989. He was a versatile player, playing in numerous positions during his career. He last managed the Los Angeles Galaxy in Major League Soccer after taking over in November 2007. Gullit is currently working to promote the Belgian-Dutch 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cup bid.

In 1981, on his 19th birthday, Gullit made his international debut as a substitute for the Dutch national team against Switzerland, a game the Dutch lost 2ñ1.

Gullit's early international career was marred by disappointment as the Dutch failed to qualify for the 1982 FIFA World Cup and Euro 84. The Dutch missed out in 1984 on goals scored as the Spanish trounced minnows Malta 12ñ1 in their final qualifying game, when they needed an 11 goal victory to qualify.

There was further disappointment in 1986 when the Dutch missed out on qualification for the World Cup at the hands of neighbours Belgium in a play-off. Having lost 1ñ0 in Belgium, the Dutch appeared to be set for qualification in Rotterdam as they led 2ñ0 until Georges Grun put the Belgians through on away goals.

However, Gullit was one of the key players for the Dutch team helping his country win the Euro 88 under coach Rinus Michels. Having lost their opening game of the tournament to the USSR the Dutch beat England and Republic of Ireland to reach the semi-finals. After defeating West Germany 2ñ1 in Hamburg the Dutch faced the Soviet Union in the final. Gullit opened the scoring with a well-placed header and Marco van Basten scored an incredible volley to cap a 2ñ0 win. Ruud Gullit was thus the first Dutch captain to hold aloft international silverware.

The Dutch travelled to Italia 90 as one of the favourites, but the team failed to perform as expected. Gullit's knee injuries clearly hampered his play, and his only moment of brilliance was a superb dribble and shot against Ireland which helped the Netherlands qualify for the second round. There they met W Germany in one of the most exciting games of the tournament, though the game was marred by an altercation between Frank Rijkaard and Rudi Voller. The Germans gained revenge for their defeat at Euro 88, by beating the Netherlands 2ñ1 and going on to win the tournament.

1992 saw the Dutch again among the favourites for silverware in Sweden at Euro 92. Gullit appeared in imperious form against Scotland in their opening game of the tournament as he supplied Dennis Bergkamp with an easy goal. But after drawing with Russia and beating Germany, the Dutch suffered a shock exit on penalties to Denmark, who ended up winning the championship's Henri Delaunay Trophy.

In 1993 Gullit and Holland manager Dick Advocaat began what was to be a long running dispute which ultimately ended Gullit's international career. Advocaat's decision to play Gullit on the right-side of midfield, in a game against England at Wembley, rather than his usual central position upset Gullit and this was exacerbated by his substitution for Marc Overmars.Gullit refused to play for the national team following this but later changed his mind and agreed to return, facing Scotland in May 1994. Shortly before the 1994 FIFA World Cup, Gullit walked out of pre-tournament training camp and would never play international football again.

Gullit's brilliance prompted George Best to comment in 1990, "Ruud Gullit is a great player by any standards. He has all the skills. He's not afraid to do things with the ball. And he looks as if he's enjoying every second of it. By my reckoning that's what makes him an even better player than Maradona. Both have the key quality you will find in all the best players: balance. You just can't knock them off the ball. It was the same with Pele, Beckenbauer and Cruijff.

Rene and his twin brother Willy were squad members of the Dutch national team that made the World Cup final in 1974 and became key players in the team that made the 1978 final. Overall, Rene appeared 47 times for his country, scoring five goals.

He is well remembered due to the incident before the 1978 World Cup final, when the opponent Argentinians objected to the bandage he wore on his injured forearm. Despite the bandage had been passed by FIFA and worn in previous matches, the referee, Italian Sergio Gonella vacillated, while the Dutch players threatened to walk off the field. Finally an extra layer of padding was applied to the bandage as a solution, and the match could start.

PROFILE:
Full name: Patrick Stephan Kluivert
Date of birth :	July 1, 1976 
Place of birth : Amsterdam, Netherlands
Height : 1.88 m 
Playing position: Striker

Mini Bio:
Patrick Stephan Kluivert  is a former Dutch footballer, currently pursuing his interest in coaching.[1] He played as a striker for AFC Ajax, A.C. Milan, FC Barcelona, Newcastle United F.C., Valencia CF, PSV Eindhoven, and Lille OSC. Kluivert played for the Dutch national team from 1994 to 2004. He is their all-time leading goalscorer with 40 goals.

Kluivert missed most of UEFA Euro 1996 with a knee injury. During the final group game and from a Dennis Bergkamp assist, he scored against England, which enabled the Netherlands to qualify for the knock-out round over Scotland on goal difference. There, they lost in a penalty shootout to France.

At the 1998 FIFA World Cup, Kluivert was sent off against Belgium by referee Pierluigi Collina after elbowing Lorenzo Staelens. He made amends when selected to play against Argentina in the quarter-finals of the same tournament where he scored the opening goal. He also impressed in later matches, scoring a late equalising goal from a header to draw his team level with Brazil in the semi-final, though the latter prevailed in the penalty shootout.

The UEFA Euro 2000 would represent Patrick Kluivert's finest hour as the spearhead of a star-studded Oranje side. Kluivert scored a hat-trick in the 6-1 quarterfinal demolition of Yugoslavia. The semi-final against Italy would provide much heartache for Kluivert, as the Dutch crashed out yet again on penalties. Neither Kluivert nor his Dutch side could find the back of the net, despite twice having a chance from the penalty spot - Kluivert himself would miss one of those penalties during the game. Despite the Dutch falling short, Kluivert will be remembered for rising to the occasion in front of partisan home crowds, scoring five goals in as many games, jointly claiming the Golden Boot with Savo Milosevic.

Kluivert would once again enter UEFA Euro 2004 wearing the famous #9 jersey for his country. But it would be a tournament to forget, as a stubborn Dick Advocaat would not turn to Kluivert even once in the tournament - Kluivert would end up being the only member of the Dutch field squad not to get even a single minute at the Euro 2004.

Apart from being left out of the 2006 FIFA World Cup squad by coach Marco van Basten, Kluivert was not called up to play in any of the qualifying games leading up to the World Cup either. This was partly due to the fact that he suffered persistent injuries which prevented him from playing for his club during the 2005-06 season.

Height : 1.78 m 
Playing position : Midfielder

Mini Bio:
Johannes "Johan" Jacobus Neeskens (born 15 September 1951 in Heemstede, Netherlands) is a Dutch football manager and former midfielder. As a player, he was an important member of the Dutch national team that finished as runner-ups in the 1974 and 1978 FIFA World Cups. Former England manager Alf Ramsay said Neeskens was "as good as any player" in the tournament. He was the assistant coach to Frank Rijkaard at Barcelona but was sacked along with Frank Rijkaard as the end of the 2007-08 season. He was the head coach of the Dutch B national team until June 2009, at which date he has been appointed as the assistant coach to Frank Rijkaard at Galatasaray SK.


Neeskens was capped 49 times for his country, scoring 17 goals. He made his debut against East Germany, and played a crucial role in the 1974 and 1978 FIFA World Cups, playing in central midfield. Neeskens scored the opening goal of the 1974 World Cup final against West Germany on a penalty kick after only 2 minutes of play.

Four years later, Neeskens was a crucial player for the Dutch (despite a rib injury suffered in the Scotland defeat), in the absence of Cruijff who had retired from international football in 1977. The Netherlands again reached the final, only to lose to the hosts, this time Argentina, going down 3-1 after extra time (the score at the end of regulation was 1-1). He played his final international game in 1981 in a 2-0 defeat against France in a qualifier for the 1982 World Cup.


In December 2005, Neeskens was appointed assistant coach of the Australian national team, once again at the request of Guus Hiddink, the Socceroos's manager at the time. He worked alongside Hiddink and Graham Arnold as part of their World Cup 2006 campaign, and even afterwards he remained involved with the Australian national team: on 7 October 2006, under contract with FC Barcelona, Neeskens was alongside the Australian national team's bench in a friendly match between Paraguay while visiting Australia for a short break.

After the 2006 World Cup, Neeskens returned to FC Barcelona to replace Henk ten Cate in the club's technical staff, reuniting with Frank Rijkaard. The three-year deal was signed when Neeskens flew in from Germany following Australia's opening win over Japan, but on 8 May 2008, after two disappointing seasons, Barcelona's president Joan Laporta announced that Neeskens (as well as Rijkaard) were to leave Barcelona at the end of the season.

PROFILE:
Full name : Rutgerus Johannes Martinus van Nistelrooĳ
Date of birth :	1 July 1976 
Place of birth : Oss, North Brabant, Netherlands
Height : 1.88 m 
Playing position : Striker

Mini Bio:
Rutgerus Johannes Martinus van Nistelrooĳ , better known as Ruud van Nistelrooy, is a Dutch professional footballer who plays as a striker for Hamburg in the German Bundesliga. He is the second-highest goalscorer in Champions League history with 60 goals. He is a three-time Champions League top scorer, as well as a top scorer in three different European domestic leagues.

Van Nistelrooy began his career with Den Bosch, before moving onto Heerenveen, eventually making a name for himself at PSV Eindhoven where he won two Dutch leagues. His goalscoring record at PSV attracted attention from Manchester United; a deal was in place in the summer of 2000, but because of injury problems his move was secured a year later for a then British record fee of £19m. His time at United was successful, winning the Premier League, FA Cup, League Cup and FA Community Shield, along with winning the Sir Matt Busby Player of the Year twice. Van Nistelrooy hit 150 goals in just 219 games for United, as well as being their all time European record goalscorer, but fell out of favour towards the end of his tenure with Real Madrid then securing his services in 2006. Although an injury blighted the end of his days with Madrid, he did win La Liga twice and the Supercopa de Espana before signing for Hamburg during the January transfer window in 2010.

Van Nistelrooy made his Netherlands debut in 1998 and went on to score 33 goals in 64 internationals for them, leaving him joint third all-time top scorer for his country. He announced his retirement from international football in 2007, before being persuaded to play again, but announced his retirement again in 2008 after the UEFA Euro 2008 tournament.

Van Nistelrooy has 64 caps and 33 goals for the Netherlands. His first tournament was Euro 2004, where he and the Czech Republic's Milan Baroš were the only players to score in all three group stage matches.

As the Dutch failed to qualify for the 2002 FIFA World Cup, Van Nistelrooy had to wait four years to play in his first and last World Cup. During a 2006 World Cup qualifying match, he scored in the Dutch's 4–0 hammering of bottom-placed Andorra and was yellow-carded for going to Andorra player Antoni Lima and celebrating in front of him, following an incident six minutes before when Nistelrooy missed a penalty and Lima laughed at him.He was a part of coach Marco van Basten's squad for the 2006 World Cup finals, for which he served as the official FIFA/SOS ambassador. He started, and was substituted, in all of the Netherlands' group stage matches, and scored his lone goal against the Côte d'Ivoire. Van Nistelrooy was benched for the Netherlands' final match, which saw them eliminated in the knockout stage by Portugal.

At Euro 2008, Van Nistelrooy scored for the Netherlands in their decisive 3–0 victory over Italy in the group stage, and scored the equaliser in their eventual 3–1 loss to Russia in the quarter-finals. On 4 August, he again announced his retirement from international competition.

During the build up to the 2010 FIFA World Cup Van Nistelrooy again made himself available, but was left out by van Marwijk, the Dutch team coach.

<p>Rob Rensenbrink</p>

PROFILE:
Full name : Pieter Robert Rensenbrink
Date of birth : July 3, 1947 
Place of birth: Amsterdam, Netherlands
Playing position : Forward

Mini Bio:
Pieter Robert ("Rob") Rensenbrink (born July 3, 1947 in Amsterdam) is a former Dutch football player and member of the Dutch national football team that reached two World Cup finals in 1974 and 1978. A creative left winger of considerable talent, he became a legend in Belgium whilst playing in the great Anderlecht side of the 1970's. A talented dribbler as well as a cool finisher, he only ever missed two penalties in his entire career, and often enjoyed telling the keeper before hand where he was going to place the ball, and then still beating him there.

Rensenbrink made his international debut for the Netherlands national football team against Scotland in 1968, but picked up relatively few caps due to competition for the forward positions with Johan Cruijff and Piet Keizer. However, Rinus Michels included him for the 1974 FIFA World Cup squad that travelled to West Germany.

The Dutch side that took part in the 1974 FIFA World Cup were the pinnacle of Total Football. Most of the 1974 team were made up of players from AFC Ajax and Feyenoord, so Rensenbrink was an outsider and was unfamiliar with playing the system. His preferred position was up front on the left, but that position was already Johan Cruijff's domain, he played on the left-wing position in midfield, taking over from Ajax player Piet Keizer. He missed one game in the tournament (when Keizer played instead) and was only half-fit for the final after picking up an injury during the semi-final against Brazil. Rinus Michels gambled on Rensenbrink's fitness and played him from start - however he only lasted until half-time and was replaced by René van de Kerkhof. The Netherlands took an early lead through a Johan Neeskens penalty, but goals from Paul Breitner and Gerd Müller gave West Germany a 2-1 victory.

Rensenbrink stayed in the Dutch national side during the qualifiers and finals of the 1976 European Football Championship. However, the Netherlands fell at the semi-final stage to Czechoslovakia.

In the 1978 FIFA World Cup tournament in Argentina, the Netherlands again reached the final, but this time without Cruijff (who decided to retire from international football) and under the guidance of Ernst Happel rather than Michels. Out of the shadow of Cruijff, Rensenbrink found more room to showcase his own considerable talent, playing on the left-hand side of a front three alongside Johnny Rep and René van de Kerkhof. He scored a hat-trick in the opening game against Iran, another against Scotland which was goal number 1000 in World Cup history and a penalty in the 5-1 win over Austria. In the final against Argentina, the Netherlands yet again met the hosts. In a tumultuous match, the Netherlands fell behind to a first-half Mario Kempes strike. After Dick Nanninga's equalizer 9 minutes from time, a long pass from the Dutch captain Ruud Krol in the last 30 seconds of normal time gave Rensenbrink a half-chance to score but his shot from a very narrow angle was deflected on to the post and bounced clear. Had he scored, it is likely that Holland would have won the World Cup with Rensenbrink being top goal scorer. Argentina scored twice in extra-time for a 3-1 victory and the Netherlands again had to settle for the runners-up spot.


Rensenbrink played some of the qualifiers for Euro 80, but after earning his 46th cap in 1979 (a 2-0 defeat by Poland in a qualifier for Euro 80), he retired from international football at the age of 32, having scored 14 times for his country. In 1980, he left Anderlecht and wound down his career with a spell at Portland Timbers in the NASL, followed by a brief stay with Toulouse in France in 1981. He along with Eusébio are the only players to score the most goals from a penalty spot in a tournament (4 in 1978).

Franklin Edmundo Rijkaard (born 30 September 1962) is a Dutch football manager and former player. Rijkaard has played for Ajax, Real Zaragoza and Milan, and represented his national side 73 times, scoring 10 goals. In his coaching career, he has been at the helm of the Dutch national side, Sparta Rotterdam and Barcelona. He is currently the head coach of Turkish Süper Lig side Galatasaray. His mother is Dutch and his father is Surinamese.

On the international stage, Rijkaard made his debut for the Netherlands in 1981. He was part of the Dutch side that won Euro 1988 with a 2–0 win in the final over the Soviet Union, playing at center-back alongside Ronald Koeman. He won a total of 73 caps and scored 10 goals. Rijkaard also played for the Netherlands during the 1990 and 1994 FIFA World Cups and at Euro 1992.


Rijkaard was involved in an unsavoury incident with Rudi Völler when West Germany played the Netherlands in the 1990 World Cup. Rijkaard was booked for a bad tackle on Völler, as Rijkaard took up position for the free kick he spat in Völler's hair. Völler complained to the referee and was booked as well. From the resulting free kick, Völler then dived, according to himself to avoid a collision with Dutch keeper Hans van Breukelen, while others, notably Rijkaard and van Breukelen, saw it as a dive in hopes for a penalty. Van Breukelen was angry at this but Rijkaard again confronted Völler by twisting his ear and stamping on his foot. Both Völler and Rijkaard were sent off but Rijkaard again spat in Völler's hair as they left the pitch and was rumoured to have repeated this on the touchline. The German press nicknamed him "Llama" for his spitting.


At Euro 1992, Rijkaard scored a late equalizer for the Netherlands in a 2–2 draw with Denmark at the semi final stage but the Dutch went out on penalties. He made his final appearance for the Netherlands in the 3–2 defeat against eventual winners Brazil in the quarter-finals of the 1994 FIFA World Cup.

Mini Bio:
Clarence Clyde Seedorf (born 1 April 1976) is a Dutch footballer, who plays as a midfielder for Italian Serie A club AC Milan. He is the only player in the world to have won the Champions League with three different clubs. He is the older brother of Chedric Seedorf.As of 18 June 2009, Seedorf and former team mate Giuseppe Bergomi are co-owners of Lega Pro Prima Divisione, formally Serie C, side Monza.

Seedorf has played in Euro 1996, (where his penalty miss proved decisive in the quarter final shootout defeat to France), the 1998 World Cup, Euro 2000 and Euro 2004. However, many have suggested that his national career could have been even more impressive if he had not let an argumentative and rebellious streak get the better of him on several occasions. In addition, he has a long history of underperforming during critical moments while playing for the national team. This was one of the reasons why former national team coach Marco van Basten decided to ignore Seedorf when he was appointed coach after Euro 2004. Thus, Seedorf did not play in the World Cup 2006 qualifying series, as well as missing out on the FIFA World Cup itself.

On 12 November 2006, Seedorf was recalled for the first time since June 2004 as a replacement for the injured Wesley Sneijder. He started and played the full 90 minutes in a 1–1 friendly draw against England. Seedorf won the last of his 87 caps for the Netherlands in 2008.In Euro 2008 qualifiers against Romania (0–0 at home) and Slovenia (1–0 away win), Seedorf played 4 and 6 minutes. There were doubts on his position within the national team, as Marco van Basten favoured players such as Rafael van der Vaart, Wesley Sneijder and Robin van Persie. On 13 May 2008, Seedorf announced that he would not take part in Euro 2008, due to his ongoing conflict with van Basten.

Clubs he featured includes Real Madrid FC ,Associazione Calcio Milan,AFC Ajax.

Place of birth : Rosario, Argentina
Height: 1.69 m 
Playing position : Striker / Winger

Mini Bio:
Lionel Andres Messi is an Argentine footballer who currently plays for Barcelona and the Argentine national team. Considered one of the best football players of his generation and frequently cited as the world's best contemporary player, Messi received several Ballon d'Or and FIFA World Player of the Year nominations by the age of 21 and won both by the age of 22. His playing style and ability have drawn comparisons to Diego Maradona, who himself declared Messi his "successor."

Lionel Messi began playing football at a young age and his potential was quickly identified by Barcelona. He left Rosario-based Newell's Old Boys's youth team in 2000 and moved with his family to Europe, as Barcelona offered treatment for his growth hormone deficiency. Making his debut in the 2004–05 season, he broke the La Liga record for the youngest footballer to play a league game, and also the youngest to score a league goal. Major honours soon followed as Barcelona won La Liga in Messi's debut season, and won a double of the league and Champions League in 2006. His breakthrough season was in 2006–07; he became a first team regular, scoring a hat-trick in El Clasico and finishing with 14 goals in 26 league games. Perhaps his most successful season was the 2008–09 season, in which Messi scored 38 goals to play an integral part in a treble-winning campaign.

Messi was the top scorer of the 2005 FIFA World Youth Championship with six goals, including two in the final game. Shortly thereafter, he became an established member of Argentina's senior international team. In 2006, he became the youngest Argentine to play in the FIFA World Cup and he won a runners-up medal at the Copa America tournament the following year. In 2008, in Beijing, he won his first international honour, an Olympic gold medal, with the Argentina Olympic football team.



In 2006 WC,The injury that kept Messi from playing for two months at the end of the 2005–06 season jeopardised his presence in the 2006 World Cup. Nevertheless, Messi was selected in the Argentina squad for the tournament on 15 May 2006. He also played in the final match before the World Cup against the Argentine U-20 team for 15 minutes and a friendly match against Angola from the 64th minute. He witnessed Argentina's opening match victory against Ivory Coast from the substitute's bench. In the next match against Serbia, Messi became the youngest player to represent Argentina at a World Cup when he came on as a substitute for Maxi Rodríguez in the 74th minute. He assisted Hernán Crespo's goal within minutes of entering the game and also scored the final goal in the 6–0 victory, making him the youngest scorer in the tournament and the sixth youngest goalscorer in the history of the World Cup.Messi started in Argentina's following 0–0 draw against the Netherlands. In the following game against Mexico, Messi came on as a substitute in the 84th minute, with the score tied at 1–1. He appeared to score a goal, but it was ruled offside with Argentina needing a late goal in extra time to proceed. Coach Jose Pekerman left Messi on the bench during the quarter-final match against Germany, which they lost 4–2 on a penalty shootout.

In 2008 Summer Olympics,Having barred Messi from playing for Argentina in the 2008 Olympics, Barcelona agreed to release him after he held talks with newly appointed coach Josep Guardiola.He joined the Argentina squad and scored the first goal in a 2–1 victory over Ivory Coast. He then scored the opening goal and assisted Angel Di Maria in the second to help his side to a 2–1 extra-time win against the Netherlands.[133] He also featured in Argentina's match against rivals Brazil, in which Argentina took a 3–0 victory, thus advancing to the final.In the gold medal match, Messi again assisted Di María for the only goal in a 1–0 victory over Nigeria.

PROFILE:
Full name : Roberto Baggio
Date of birth : February 18, 1967 
Place of birth : Caldogno, Italy
Height : 1.74 m 
Playing position : Second striker/Winger (retired)

Mini Bio:
Roberto Baggio (born 18 February 1967) is a retired Italian footballer. In his career, he played for Fiorentina, Juventus, AC Milan and Internazionale. In 1993, Baggio won both the Ballon d'Or and the FIFA World Player of the Year. He is the only Italian player ever to score in three World Cups. Baggio is known as Il Divin Codino (The Divine Ponytail), for the hairstyle he wore for most of his career and his Buddhist background.

Baggio totalled 27 goals in 56 caps for his national team, the fourth-highest of all time for Italy. He is the only Italian player ever to score in three World Cups, with a total of 9 career World Cup goals which puts him even with Christian Vieri and Paolo Rossi as Italy's top World Cup scorers. For all his talent he was never rewarded with a victory in an international competition. He infamously missed the deciding penalty in the final of the 1994 FIFA World Cup, which contributed to Italy losing the trophy to Brazil.

In 1990 FIFA World Cup,Baggio's first World Cup was the 1990 FIFA World Cup, and although he was used most often as a substitute in the tournament, he was still able to display his quality, scoring twice including the "goal of the tournament" against Czechoslovakia. Baggio is also much remembered for his class; although regularly designated the penalty taker for his team, he stepped aside when Italy was awarded one in the third place match, allowing teammate Salvatore Schillaci to score and capture the Golden Shoe.

In 1994 FIFA World Cup,Baggio was the cornerstone of the Italy team during the 1994 FIFA World Cup, leading them to the final after a disappointing start. He scored five goals, all in the knockout phase, and he started every match from the beginning: two in the round of 16 to beat Nigeria (scoring with 2 minutes left of the game sending it into extra time, and then another goal in extra time), one in the quarter-finals to top Spain (the game winner with 3 minutes remaining) and two to beat Bulgaria in the semi-finals. Baggio was not fully fit for the final against Brazil, which ended 0-0 after extra time; he took Italy's last penalty in the resulting shoot-out, but his kick went over the cross-bar and the Brazilians won the title. Two other Italians, Franco Baresi and Daniele Massaro, had already missed penalties.Baggio finished tied for third in the tournament in goals scored and was named one of the top three players.

In 1998 FIFA World Cup,In Italy's opening match of the 1998 FIFA World Cup, Italy played Chile. Italy's first goal was scored by Christian Vieri on an assist by Baggio. Towards the end of the game a Baggio cross touched a Chilean defender's hand, resulting in a penalty scored by Baggio which, made the score 2-2. With this goal, he became the first Italian player to score in three World Cups.He scored two goals in the tournament; he also scored the winning goal against Austria as Italy topped their group.

Playing position: Sweeper (Retired)

Mini Bio:
Franco Baresi (born May 8, 1960 in Travagliato, province of Brescia) is an Italian youth team coach and former football defender with Milan, acknowledged as one of the greatest defenders ever to play the game. Baresi was colloquially called "piscinin", Milanese dialect for "little one".

He is also the younger brother of Internazionale assistant manager Giuseppe Baresi. Hoping Franco could play with him in the nerazzurri; Giuseppe brought him for a trial in Inter's youth team, but Franco was rejected. Despite this setback, he didn't give up and decided to try out for arch-rivals Milan, where he was accepted.


Baresi was selected for three World Cups for Italy, in 1982, 1990 and 1994. Baresi was part of the 1982 World Cup squad in Spain aged 22 as understudy to Gaetano Scirea, but didn't play, just like in the 1980 European Football Championship, where he was called up along with his brother Giuseppe.

His international debut came later in 1982 in a match against Romania. He missed the 1986 tournament, coach Enzo Bearzot preferring Juventus centre-halves Cabrini and Gentile, with Scirea in Baresi's position of libero. Baresi was unfortunate that his early international career coincided with the peak of Gaetano Scirea's stint as Italy's first choice sweeper, and Baresi was continually left out in the cold, much to his frustration, and he refused to play for the national side while Bearzot was in charge (thus explaining Baresi's relative lack of caps before the 1990 tournament). When the Azzuri crashed out to France in the 1986 tournament and Scirea retired, the mantle was passed to Baresi who returned to the side, a responsibility that become more poignant when Scirea was killed in a car accident aged 36, only months before Italy was to host the World Cup. So Baresi made his World Cup debut in 1990. The Azzurri lost to Argentina in the semi-finals, but went on to beat England in the third place play off.

In the 1994 World Cup he came one step closer to lifting the trophy as Italy finished runners-up. Baresi injured himself early in the tournament in the group match against Norway, and after emergency surgery, was able to return for the final against Brazil. Baresi suffered cramp in extra time as the patched-up Italians defended against a tired Brazil to a 0-0 score after 120 minutes, Romário later attributing his quiet performance to "The most ruthless monitoring of my entire career". Baresi missed the first penalty in the shootout and Italy went on to lose the first World Cup Final to be decided on penalties.

He was also a member of the Italian squad that finished fourth at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, California.

Place of birth: Milan, Italy
Height: 6 ft 1 in
Playing position : Defender

Mini Bio:
Giuseppe Bergomi (born 22 December 1963) is a former Italian footballer, who spent his entire career at Internazionale Milano. He currently holds the record of most appearances for the club, having enjoyed 19 seasons with the same team.

Equally at ease as a centre or right back, Bergomi and the likes of Milan legend Franco Baresi and Juventus greats Gaetano Scirea and Antonio Cabrini formed the backbone of the Italian defence for much of the 1980's and were part of the 1982 FIFA World Cup-winning squad.

He is affectionately referred to as "Lo zio" ("the uncle") because of the impressive moustache he wore, even as a 18-year old in the 1982 World Cup. Also considered one of the greatest defenders in the history of the game, he was also dubbed "Il Capitano" ("the captain") as he served as club captain.

Born in Milan, Bergomi made his professional debut in the 1980–81 season, at the age of 17. The 19 seasons he went on to spend with his sole club, Inter Milan, were often in the shadow of A.C. Milan, as he only won the scudetto once, in 1989 (he did win the UEFA Cup on three occasions). For a moment in his career, he held the records for both the most appearances in European competition by an Italian player and the most Milan derbies played, both broken by Paolo Maldini.

With the national team, Bergomi won the 1982 FIFA World Cup, and also played in the 1986 and 1990 campaigns, as well as UEFA Euro 1988. After being sent off in a match against Norway in an Euro 1992 qualifier, Bergomi spent years without getting a callback to the Azzurri, but received a surprise recall for the 1998 World Cup, at nearly 35, after playing 28 times in the league and leading the Nerazzurri to the UEFA Cup - his third and last.

He retired in 1999 at almost 36, with a total of 81 appearances for his country. He is now working as a football pundit and commentator for Italian satellite television Sky Italia, often commentating with Fabio Caressa and commented Italy's matches in the 2006 FIFA World Cup.

Del Piero also broke his appearance record on 14 February 2010 when he played his 445th Serie A game. Notably, Boniperti is the tenth-highest goalscorer of all-time in Serie A and was named by Pele as one of the top 125 greatest living footballers in March 2004.

After playing only 14 games in the Serie A league, Boniperti was called up to play for the Italian national football team, for a game against Austria, the match ended in a humiliating 5-1 drubbing to the Austrian side.

He got even with Austria a couple of years later, when in May 1949 he scored his first international goal for Italy, with a 3-1 victory. Although Boniperti's international career was not particularly great he did manage to achieve 38 caps (24 of which he played as captain) and scored 8 goals for the azzurri. Boniperti played for Italy in the 1950 and 1954 FIFA World Cup finals.

At the time of retirement, Boniperti was Juventus' all-time top goalscorer with 182 in all competitions, this record would stand for over 40 years before Alessandro Del Piero broke it on 10 January 2006. Currently, Giampiero Boniperti is the second top goalscorer of all-time at Juventus and is sixth on the list of all-time top appearances for the club. He held the record for most Serie A appearances at Juventus with 444 games until long-serving player and current Juventus captain Alessandro Del Piero broke it in February 2010 when he started the match against Genoa.

Height:1.91 m 
Playing position: Goalkeeper

Mini Bio:
Gianluigi "Gigi" Buffon (born 28 January 1978 in Carrara), is an Italian FIFA World Cup, UEFA Cup, and Serie A winning goalkeeper who plays for Serie A club Juventus and the Italian national team. He is considered by many fans and experts to be one of most dominant and successful goalkeepers in recent history. Buffon was declared by Pele to be one of the 125 greatest living footballers in the world, and has also been named the Serie A Goalkeeper of the Year a record nine times.


Buffon was awarded his first cap for Italy on 29 October 1997, at the age of nineteen, as an injury replacement for Gianluca Pagliuca during a qualifier for 1998 FIFA World Cup play-off against Russia. He was called up for the 1998 World Cup finals, but did not play a single game as Pagliuca remained first choice. He was a member of the Italy squad at the 1996 Summer Olympics, the 2002 World Cup and Euro 2004. Buffon was also the first choice goalkeeper for Italy at the Euro 2000, but broke his hand in a friendly match against Norway just eight days before the tournament started, and had his starting place taken by Francesco Toldo.

During the 2006 World Cup finals, Buffon was in stunning form, as he conceded just two goals and kept five clean sheets, in addition to a 453-minute scoreless streak. The only goals he conceded were an own goal by teammate Cristian Zaccardo against the United States and a Zinedine Zidane penalty in the final against France, which ended 1–1 in extra-time and led to a penalty shootout in which neither Buffon nor Fabien Barthez saved a spot kick. The lone miss was David Trezeguet's effort which clanged off the bottom of the crossbar and failed to cross the line, which enabled Italy's Fabio Grosso to seal the victory for the Azzuri. Buffon received the Yashin Award for his accomplishments throughout the competition. Buffon recorded five clean sheets in the 2006 FIFA World Cup and has a career total of six.

Buffon was named Italy captain for Euro 2008 after incumbent Fabio Cannavaro was ruled out of the tournament due to injury. In the second game of the group stage against Romania on 13 June, he saved an 81st minute penalty from Adrian Mutu as the match ended 1–1 to keep Italy's hopes alive. Buffon kept a clean sheet against France in the final group game. Italy were eliminated in the quarter-finals nine days later after a 4-2 penalty shootout loss to Spain in which Buffon saved one penalty.

Playing position : Second Striker

Mini Bio:
Alessandro Del Piero  is an Italian World Cup-winning footballer who plays for Serie A club Juventus.

Del Piero was named in the FIFA 100, a list of the 125 greatest living footballers selected by Pelé as a part of FIFA's centenary celebrations.Brazilian star Ronaldinho proclaimed that Del Piero is his idol.Del Piero was also voted in the list of best European players for the past 50 years in the UEFA Golden Jubilee Poll. In the year 2000, Del Piero was the world's best-paid football player from salary, bonuses and advertising revenue.

Along with three awards in Italy for gentlemanly conduct he has also won the Golden Foot award, which pertains to personality and playing ability.

Del Piero usually plays as a supporting-striker and occasionally between the midfield and the strikers, known in Italy as the "trequartista" position. Although he is not very tall, Del Piero's playing style is regarded by critics as creative in attacking, assisting many goals as well as scoring himself, as opposed to just "goal poaching." His free-kick and penalty taking is also highly regarded. Del Piero has become famous over the years for scoring from a special "Del Piero Zone", approaching from the left flank and curling a precise lob into the far top corner of the goal.

Del Piero holds the all-time goalscoring record at Juventus.On April 6, 2008, Alessandro Del Piero became the all-time highest-capped Juventus player, ahead of Juve legend Gaetano Scirea. As of May 2010, he is in eighth place in the UEFA Champions League all-time goalscorer records and joint fourth with Roberto Baggio within the Italian national team records.

Del Piero is currently Italy's fourth all-time leading scorer. His tournament debut was Euro 96, but made his only appearance in the first half of a match against Russia before being substituted at halftime. Del Piero competed with fan favorite Roberto Baggio for a spot on the 1998 FIFA World Cup final roster while struggling to recover from injury suffered during the 1998 Champions League final with Juventus. He also missed two gilt-edged chances in Italy's 2-1 loss to France in the Euro 2000 final.

He returned to the international scene in the 2002 FIFA World Cup, after a season in Serie A in which Juventus won the Scudetto. Del Piero scored the decisive goal against Hungary, which sealed the Azzurri's qualification for the finals.He instantly scored with a header against Mexico after coming on as a substitute, a goal which saved Italy from the ignominy of a first round exit. The goal sent Italy through to the second round, where they were eliminated due to a golden goal in a controversial match against S. Korea.

As of 2008, Del Piero has captained Italy seven times (including Euro 2008) . He also regularly wore the number 10, but later gave it to Francesco Totti and switched to the number 7, as it was the first number he wore at the start of his career. Even though the number 10 was vacated after Totti retired from the national team in July 2007, Del Piero denied any interest in taking back the number, saying he was satisfied with the number 7. On May he was recalled by popular demand to Italy's UEFA Euro 2008 squad after nine-month absence from international duty, and thus became the second Italian player to participate in 7 major international tournaments (EURO 1996, 2000, 2004, 2008; World Cup 1998, 2002, 2006).

Del Piero was called up to Italy's squad for the UEFA Euro 2008 Championship in Austria and Switzerland. He was mostly on the substitutes' bench but started against Romania as the squad's captain. In the group match against the Dutch, he came on for the under-performing Antonio Di Natale and made an immediate impact, including several efforts on goal. However he could not prevent the Azzurri from a 3-0 loss. Italy qualified through the group stage in second-place behind Holland, eliminating Romania and France. In the quarter-final against Spain, Del Piero made a substitute appearance during extra-time, and with the game ending in a 0-0 draw, it was decided by a penalty shootout in which Spain won 4-2.On 20 August 2008 he won his 90th cap for Italy in friendly against Austria - only the fifth Azzurri player to reach this landmark. Despite announcing that he will carry on playing until he is 40 years old, he has not been called up since Italy's qualifier against Georgia on September 10, 2008.

The semifinal between Germany and Italy produced an entertaining extra time period that went scoreless until the 118th minute, when Italy scored twice through Fabio Grosso and Alessandro Del Piero, putting an end to Germany's undefeated record in Dortmund, and continued their dominance over Die Nationalelf.

Mini Bio:
Giacinto Facchetti (18 July 1942 – 4 September 2006) was an Italian football player. From January 2004 until his death, he was President of Internazionale, the club for which he played for his whole career during the 1960s and 1970s, playing 634 official games and scoring 75 goals. He played for the Internazionale team remembered as “La Grande Inter”. Facchetti is remembered as one of the first truly great attacking-full backs. He would make marauding runs upfield using his wonderful dribbling and crossing. He could also play at centre-back where his tackling was used to great effect. He also possessed wonderful stamina and scored important goals.

With his club, Facchetti won four scudetti in 1963, 1965, 1966 and 1971; one Italian Cup in 1978; two European Champions Clubs’ Cups in 1964 and 1965; and two Intercontinental Cups in 1964 and 1965.

Facchetti made his debut for Italy on 23 March 1963. He was capped 94 times (a record at the time, since overtaken only by Dino Zoff, Paolo Maldini and Fabio Cannavaro), wearing the captain's armband 70 times and scoring three goals. He played for his country at the 1966, 1970 (where his team was runner-up to Brazil losing the final by 4-1), and 1974 FIFA World Cups, and was part of the winning Italian squad at Euro 68. In March 2004, Pelé named him one of the top 125 greatest living footballers.

Giacinto was sent off only once, for sarcastically applauding the referee.

Over the years Facchetti held various managerial positions at Inter, including technical director, board member, worldwide ambassador and vice president. Facchetti was elected president of Inter on 19 January 2004. After a long illness, he died of pancreatic cancer in Milan on 4 September 2006. He is survived by his wife, Giovanna, and four children.

In an unprecedented move by the club, Inter retired the number 3 shirt in his honour.

On Monday 22 September 2008, a square in the town of Cesano Maderno, Milan was renamed in honor of Giacinto Facchetti.

Date of birth : 26 June 1968 (age 41)
Place of birth: Milan, Italy
Height: 1.86 m 
Playing position : Left back / Centre back

Mini Bio:
Paolo Cesare Maldini (born 26 June 1968 in Milan, Italy) is a retired Italian footballer. He spent all 25 seasons of his career at Serie A club Milan, before retiring at the age of 40. During that period, Maldini won the UEFA Champions League a record five times, as well as seven Serie A titles, one Coppa Italia, five Supercoppa Italiana, five European Super Cups, two Intercontinental Cups and one FIFA Club World Cup. He played for 14 years for the Italian national team, making his debut in 1988 before retiring in 2002 with 126 caps scoring 7 goals.

Maldini's father, Cesare formerly played for and captained Milan and is a successful national U-21 coach.

In 1986, Maldini was called up by his father Cesare to the Italian U-21 side, where he earned twelve caps and scored five goals in two years. He made his Azzurri debut at the age of nineteen on 31 March 1988, in a 1–1 friendly draw against Yugoslavia, and made one appearance for Italy at the 1988 Olympics. Maldini featured in all four of Italy's games at Euro 1988, and participated in his first World Cup in 1990, where Italy lost to Argentina in the semifinals on penalties.

Maldini's first international goal came in his 44th career match, in a 2–0 friendly win over Mexico on 20 January 1993. He captained Italy at the start of the 1994 World Cup, losing to Brazil in the final on penalties. He was named in the Team of the Tournament, 32 years after his father received the same honor at the 1962 World Cup. Euro 1996 would see Italy eliminated in the group stage, and the quarterfinals of the 1998 World Cup. Italy did reach the final of Euro 2000, but lost to France in extra time.

After Italy were eliminated in the 2002 World Cup round of sixteen, Maldini retired trophyless from international competition as Italy's most capped player. He scored seven international goals, all coming in home games. He spent over half of his 16 years as an international as team captain, wearing the armband a record 74 times.

In February 2009, Italian head coach Marcello Lippi declared his support for a testimonial match for Maldini, stating that it would give him a chance to play for the Azzurri for a final time. Italian Football Federation offered him a place in the line-up in a friendly match against Northern Ireland. However, Maldini rejected the offer, saying that he wanted to part with football in an "official" match.

Prior to his retirement, Maldini expressed that he would never be moving into a coaching career.He was offered a position that would have reunited him with his former manager, Carlo Ancelotti, by joining Chelsea as a coach having reportedly met with Ancelotti and with Chelsea's owner, Roman Abramovich, to discuss such a possibility.On 30 June 2009, Ancelotti announced that Maldini had turned down his offer to become part of Chelsea's coaching staff.

Mini Bio:
Alessandro Giovanni Faccutio Nesta, Cavaliere Ufficiale OMRI (born March 19, 1976 in Rome), commonly known as Alessandro Nesta is an Italian World Cup-winning footballer who plays as a defender for Serie A club Milan. Considered by some as one of the best centre backs to have ever played the game, he is a four-time member of the annual UEFA Team of the Year, second only to Barcelona striker Thierry Henry and Barcelona defender Carles Puyol with five appearances.

Nesta was a member of the Under-21 squad that won the 1996 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship, in which he was named the top defender of the competition. He earned his first cap for the Azzurri against Moldova on October 5, 1996. He has been capped 78 times for Italy, and participated in Euro 1996, the 1998 FIFA World Cup, Euro 2000, the 2002 World Cup, Euro 2004, and the 2006 World Cup. He usually partnered captain Fabio Cannavaro in the heart of the defense.

During the 2006 World Cup, he suffered an injury in Italy's group match against the Czech Republic, and was forced to leave the match early. This made it three times unlucky for Nesta; he previously ruptured a knee ligament against Austria during the 1998 FIFA World Cup, and missed Italy's final game in the 2002 FIFA World Cup with an injured foot.

After the 2006 FIFA World Cup, Nesta's continuous injuries forced him to retire from the international team. Coach Roberto Donadoni unsuccessfully tried to persuade him to come out of retirement for Euro 2008.

<p>Gianni Rivera</p>

PROFILE:
Full name: Giovanni Rivera
Date of birth : 18 August 1943 
Place of birth : Alessandria, Italy
Height : 1.75 m
Playing position : Midfielder

Mini Bio:
Giovanni ("Gianni") Rivera (born 18 August 1943 in Alessandria) is an Italian former football midfielder, mostly a deep-lying playmaker, who was awarded the Ballon d'Or, one of the most prestigious individual awards in football, in 1969. He played the majority of his career with Serie A side A.C. Milan. Internationally, he represented Italy, 60 times scoring 14 goals, at four World Cups (1962, 1966, 1970, and 1974). As well as being part of the first Italian side to win the European Football Championship in 1968. He currently is a Member of the European Parliament for the Uniti nell'Ulivo party.

Nicknamed the Golden Boy of Italian football, Rivera was the product of Alessandria's youth football academy and made his debut in Serie A for Alessandria against Internazionale on June 2, 1959 at the age of only fifteen years. He played 26 matches for his first club, in which he scored 6 goals. After one year, he was bought by AC Milan to replace Juan Schiaffino with a record transfer fee for that time, $200,000; he was only sixteen years old. In 1962 he won the first scudetto with AC Milan and on May 13, 1962, at eighteen, he played his first match for the Italian national team against West Germany at the World Cup in Chile, a game that finished with a goalless draw, 0-0.

Due to their win of the 1962 scudetto, AC Milan qualified for the European Cup in 1962, a European Cup which they finally won, beating Benfica 2-1 in the final with Rivera in great form as he was awarded second place in the famous Ballon d'or award, which was won by the Russian goalkeeper Lev Yashin.

In the 1967/1968 season, Rivera won with AC Milan both the title and the Cup Winners' Cup. In 1968, he played for Italy as they won at the European Championship. Sadly, he missed the final match against Yugoslavia through an injury he received at the semi-final against Soviet Union. Next season, Rivera took AC Milan to win the Champions Cup as he finally got the Ballon d'or award.

He played with the Squadra Azzurra (Italian national team) in the 1970 FIFA World Cup hosted by Mexico, where they reached the final, losing against Brazil, 4-1. The Italian coach at the 1970 World Cup Final, Ferruccio Valcareggi, believed that Gianni Rivera and his teammate Sandro Mazzola could not play together on the same field. Although Gianni Rivera was the more famous of the two, Valcareggi elected to start Mazzola. However, by 2nd round, the Italian offense failed to sparkle. Valcareggi devised a solution he called "staffetta" (relay) to play both players. Mazzola would start in the first half while Rivera would come in at halftime. With this strategy, Rivera helped to beat the host Mexico in the quarterfinal and West Germany in the semifinal, in which Rivera played a major role in one of the best matches in World Cup history, scoring the goal of the success of Italy (4-3). However, in the final against Brazil, Valcareggi did not use Rivera until there were only six minutes left in the game, despite Rivera being the hero of the past two matches.

He also played in the 1974 FIFA World Cup but did not appear in the match where the Italians were knocked out by Poland, 2-1. That was the end of Rivera's career at the national team for which he played in 60 games, scoring 14 goals.

Rivera took AC Milan in two Cup Winners' Cup finals, one in 1973 and another in 1974; the first one was won and the second lost. With the Rossonieri, he also won two consecutive Italian titles, in 1972 and 1973. AC Milan also won several Italian Cups in the 70's but were missing Rivera in most of them, as he was banned because of his statements against Italian referees.

Rivera won the last scudetto of his playing career in 1979 with AC Milan, this also being the tenth title for "The Devils". In total, he played for AC Milan in 501 Serie A matches and scored 160 goals.

After retirement, Rivera became a vice-president at the club. When Silvio Berlusconi bought the club in 1986, he left and entered the Italian political life, being one of the members of the Italian Parliament. He served as an under-secretary for defense under Romano Prodi's government. He was named by Pelé as one of the top 125 greatest living footballers in March 2004.

<p>Paolo Rossi</p>

PROFILE:
Date of birth: September 23, 1955 
Place of birth: Prato, Italy
Height : 1.77 m 
Playing position : Striker

Mini Bio:

Paolo Rossi (born 23 September 1955 in Prato) is an Italian former football striker. In 1982, he led Italy to the 1982 FIFA World Cup title, scoring six goals to win the Golden Boot/top scorer honors, and the Golden Ball. Rossi is one of only two players to have won all three honours at a single tournament (the other is the Argentinian Mario Kempes, in 1978). Javier Saviola, Lionel Messi, Sergio Agüero and Dominic Adiyiah accomplished this in junior teams, in the 2001, 2005, 2007 and 2009 FIFA U-20 World Cups respectively. He is listed among Pele's 125 all-time greatest footballers.

Rossi returned just in time for 1982 FIFA World Cup, but Italian journalists and tifosi lamented he was in very poor shape. This view seemed to be confirmed by Italy's first, appalling three matches, in which he was allegedly described as a ghost aimlessly wandering over the field. Rossi was willing to attack but lacked the fortitude to produce.

Bearzot, however, staunchly confirmed Rossi for the decisive round robin, in which his team was to face Argentina, the reigning World Champions, and Brazil, the biggest favourites to win the title with a team consisting of world-class players such as Sócrates, Zico, and Falcão. After Italy defeated Argentina 2-1 on the defensive work of Gentile and Scirea, who shut down Diego Maradona, Rossi scored three memorable goals to shock Brazil 3-2 to qualify for the semi finals against Poland, where his two goals again won the match for Italy. In the final against Germany, Rossi scored the first of Italy's three goals on a free-kick assist from Gentile to win the match 3-1, giving his team their third World Cup. With six goals total, he won the tournament's maximo goleador award--the Golden Boot--as well.

Italian fans hung banners proclaiming him "Man of the match". Rossi's accomplishments in Spain gained him the title of European Footballer of the Year and World Player of the Year in 1982.

Rossi scored a total of 20 goals in 48 caps for Italy. Undoubtedly, his most important goal was the winner against Brazil in the 1982 World Cup which completed a famous hatrick and enabled the Azzurri to advance at the expense of the South Americans. Rossi further represented Italy in the 1991 edition of the World Cup of Masters, scoring in the third place play off against Uruguay.

Mini Bio:
Francesco Totti, Cavaliere Ufficiale OMRI,(born 27 September 1976 in Rome) is an Italian World Cup-winning footballer who is the current captain of Serie A club Roma. His position is that of a striker or an attacking midfielder, though he is best known for playing as a second striker. Totti has spent his entire career at Roma, is the number-one goalscorer and the most capped player in the club's history. "Er Pupone," as he is commonly nicknamed, is considered one of the greatest players in his generationand also one of Roma's greatest players ever.

Totti has won several awards in Italy during his career including a record five Italian Footballer of the Year awards and two Serie A Footballer of the Year awards. He was named by Pelé as one of the top 125 greatest living footballers in March 2004.

Totti is currently the top active Serie A goalscorer, and sixth all-time in league history with 192 goals.

Totti first came into international prominence while playing in the UEFA youth tournaments and won the UEFA under-21 championships in 1996. After starring with the Azzurrini in Italy's Under-19 and Under-21 sides, he earned his first cap for Italy during a Euro 2000 qualifying victory against Switzerland on 10 October 1998.

Italy went to Euro 2000 with Totti and he was in excellent form. He scored 2 goals during the tournament. The first goal against co-host nation Belgium in the first round and the second goal against Romania in the quarter-finals. Though Italy lost to France in the final, Totti was named the man of the match[21] and he was selected for the 22-man Team of the Tournament.

Disappointment followed at the 2002 World Cup, with Totti failing to make a significant impact and then being sent off during Italy's second-round loss to South Korea after being handed a controversial second yellow card by Byron Moreno for an alleged dive in the penalty area.

Though Totti recovered in time to join the national team for the 2006 World Cup, he was not completely in game shape after three months on the sidelines following his injury against Empoli, and played with metal plates in his ankle that had yet to be removed. He nonetheless was a regular fixture in the Marcello Lippi's side. During the tournament he played behind the lone striker Luca Toni rather than as a pairing, notably scoring the lone goal via a penalty in Italy's 1–0 win over Australia on 26 June, and starting in the final against France until being substituted in the 61st minute. Italy went on to win the World Cup, and Totti was selected for the 23-man All-Star Team

Place of birth : Bologna, Italy
Height: 1.86 m 
Playing position: Striker

Mini Bio:
Christian Vieri (born 12 July 1973 in Bologna) is a retired Italian footballer.

Vieri has scored 23 goals in 49 matches for Italy and played for his country at the 1998 World Cup, scoring five times, and the 2002 World Cup, scoring four times, though he endured a less successful tournament at Euro 2004, whilst he missed Euro 2000 and 2006 World Cup through injury. Vieri is generally considered to be Italy's greatest pure striker of recent times despite strong competition, and is one of Italy's most prolific World Cup goal scorers. He was named by Pelé as one of the 125 greatest living footballers in March 2004.

Vieri received his first international cap during the 1996–97 season after some impressive displays for Juventus. He scored a key goal for Italy in the play off against Russia during qualification for the 1998 World Cup. At the finals of the tournament in France he formed a strong partnership with Roberto Baggio. Vieri opened the scoring against Chile after a delightful assist from his strike partner. He went on to score 3 more goals during the group stages. Vieri scored Italy's only goal in the round of 16 match against Norway. He scored Italy's fourth penalty in the quarterfinal shooutout against France but Luigi Di Biagio missed the fifth and Italy were eliminated.

Vieri missed out on Euro 2000 after suffering a recurrence of an old thigh injury, during the 4th place playoff with Parma at the end of the 1999–2000 season after a collision with Gianluigi Buffon, who would also miss out on the tournament.

Italy played Vieri as a lone striker in the 2002 World Cup, scoring four goals in four games. He managed a brace in the opening game against Ecuador and scored Italy's only goal in the 2-1 defeat to Croatia despite having a previous goal controversially ruled out for offside. In the Round of 16 match against South Korea he opened the scoring in the 18th minute, scoring a powerful header from a Francesco Totti corner. Italy led the game until the Koreans equalised 3 minutes before the end. Italy was eventually eliminated by South Korea by a golden goal.

Vieri was once again the main striker in Italy's ill fated Euro 2004 campaign. However, this time he did not fare so well, scoring no goals as Italy were eliminated in the first round.

Vieri also missed 2006 World Cup after suffering a knee meniscus injury in a Ligue 1 match against Paris Saint-Germain on 26 March 2006.  Although Vieri would not necessarily have been a starter for Lippi's side, Lippi admitted that he would have picked him had he been fit.

<p>Dino Zoff</p>

PROFILE:
Date of birth: February 28, 1942 
Place of birth: Mariano del Friuli, Italy
Height:1.83 m 
Playing position: Goalkeeper

Mini Bio:
Dino Zoff (born February 28, 1942 in Mariano del Friuli) is an Italian former football goalkeeper and is the oldest winner ever of the World Cup, which he earned as captain of the Italian team in the 1982 tournament in Spain, at the age of 40.

Zoff was a goalkeeper of outstanding ability and has a place in the history of the sport among the very best in this role, being named the 3rd greatest goalkeeper of the 20th century by the IFFHS behind Lev Yashin and Gordon Banks. He holds the record for the longest playing time without allowing goals in international tournaments (1142 minutes) set between 1972 and 1974. With 112 caps he is third only to Fabio Cannavaro and Paolo Maldini in number of appearances for the Azzurri. In 2004 Pelé named him as one of the 125 greatest living footballers.


Zoff's career got off to an inauspicious start, when at the age of fourteen he had trials with Inter Milan and Juventus F.C., but was rejected due to a lack of height. Five years later, having grown by 33 centimetres, he made his Serie A debut with Udinese, though Zoff made only four appearances for Udinese before moving to Mantova in 1963.

In 1968, Zoff was transferred to Napoli. In the same year he made his debut for Italy, playing against Bulgaria in the quarter final of the 1968 European Championships. Italy proceeded to win the tournament, Zoff taking home a winners' medal after only his fourth international appearance.

Left out of the Italian starting eleven in the 1970 FIFA World Cup, Zoff resumed his success after signing for Juventus in 1972. In eleven years with Juventus, Zoff won the Serie A championship six times, the Coppa Italia twice and the UEFA Cup once. However, Zoff's greatest feat came in the 1982 FIFA World Cup, where he captained Italy to victory in the tournament at the age of 40, making him the oldest ever winner of the World Cup. He followed in the footsteps of compatriot Giampiero Combi (1934) as only the second goalkeeper to captain a World Cup-winning side. He was also voted as the Best Goalkeeper of the Tournament. His manager Enzo Bearzot said.He was a level-headed goalkeeper, capable of staying calm during the toughest and the most exhilarating moments. He always held back both out of modesty and respect for his opponents. At the end of the Brazil match, he came over to give me a kiss on the cheek, without saying a single word. For me, that fleeting moment was the most intense of the entire World Cup.»

Zoff and Gianpiero Combi (in 1934) are the only goalkeepers to captain a team that won the World Cup. Zoff is also the oldest player ever to have won the trophy. He holds the record for the longest stretch (1142 minutes) without allowing any goals in international football, set between 1972 and 1974. That clean sheet stretch was ended by Haitian soccer player Manno Sanon's beautiful goal during the 1974 World Cup. He also held the records for the oldest Serie A player and most Serie A appearances (570 matches) for more than 20 years, until the season 2005–06 when the record was broken by S.S. Lazio goalkeeper Marco Ballotta and A.C. Milan defender Paolo Maldini respectively.

After retiring as a footballer, Zoff went on to become coach for the Italian national team and several other Italian clubs.
