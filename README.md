# Freelancing

Some companies want proof that i worked as a freelancer. Here it is. This is the initial phase where i lerant a lot.

I started learning android on my own. This was my baby steps to the android world. Few projects on java swing also.

I don't remember the dates and year exactly for each and every project. But this was during late 2012, 2013-2014 period.

Made mistakes. Took help of stackoverflow. Corrected mistakes done. I am better Android Developer than before.
