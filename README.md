I started learning android on my own. This was my baby steps to the android world.

Some companies want proof that i worked as a freelancer. Here it is. This is the initial phase where i lerant a lot.

Made mistakes. Took help of stackoverflow. Corrected mistakes done. I am better Android Developer than before.
